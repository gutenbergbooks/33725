<p class='c fsl'>INTRODUCTION</p>

<p>A pack-burro camping trip in an unexplored region of the high Sierras results
in a series of adventures for three boys in the late teens, a young Geological
Survey man and the old prospector who guides them.</p>

<p>They meet bears and catch rainbow trout, are carried to fight fire by the
Forest Service Air Patrol, and trail the incendiaries through a labyrinthian
limestone cave. They ride in a lumber camp rodeo and experience earthquakes and
avalanches. And in the glacier-gouged canyons, the giant Sequoias, and sulphur
springs, they trace the story of the geological formation of the earth, and its
evolution from the days of dinosaurs.</p>

<p class='cln1'>THE RODEO</p>
</div>

<p>Ted Smith, flinging his long legs off a frisky bay, grinned delightedly as
his eye caught a flag-decked touring car.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you riding?&#8221; called the boy at the wheel.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure AM!&#8221; drawled the ranch boy. &#8220;How about yourself?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Betcher life, Old Kid!&#8221; Ace King flung himself to the ground,
disclosing the fact of his new leather chaps&mdash;a contrast to Ted&#8217;s overalls.
Greetings followed between Ted and Senator King in the back seat, and Pedro
Martinez, a black-eyed young fellow who sat a pinto pony alongside.</p>

<p>The slanting rays of California sunshine were fanned by a breeze from
Huntington Lake, as the crowd sifted about the corral fence at Cedar
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2'></a>2</span>Crest. The prevailing khaki of the dusty onlookers gave way at
intervals to a splash of color. An Indian in a purple shirt was borrowing the
orange chaps of another broncho-buster; he had drawn number two from the hat.
Most of the cowmen offset their &#8220;two-quart&#8221; sombreros with brilliant-hued
bandannas knotted loosely at their throats. A few wore chaparreras in stamped
leather, and a few in goatskin&mdash;red or black or tan&mdash;though most let it go at
plain blue overalls. One of the machines drawn up beside the soda-pop stand
fluttered a flag on its nose. For the Fourth was to be marked by a reading of
the Declaration of Independence before the rodeo and barbecue. (The day had
begun with a Parade of Horribles, in which every last lumberman took part,
chanting the marching song to an accompaniment of well-belabored
frying-pans.)</p>

<p>Unbidden, a band of unspeakably unwashed Digger Indians, attired in gay and
ill-assorted rags, appeared, and seated themselves on the opposite hill-side,
beaming vacuously as the ox was put in the pit to roast (together with two
smaller carcasses that the camp cook winkingly designated as wild mutton, though
he was careful <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3'></a>3</span>to bury the antlers against the possible advent of the
Forest Ranger).</p>

<p>The rodeo master, a megaphone-voiced blond giant, in high-heeled riding boots
and spurs that made him limp when he walked, careened up and down the dusty
field on a high-stepping bay, while two lasso men in steel-studded belts and
leather cuffs helped round the range stock into the adjoining small corral.</p>

<p>An unbroken two-year-old with wild, rolling eyes tried to climb the fence
when the rope tightened on his throat, and a sleek mule kicked out in a way that
left a red mark on the flank of a lean white mare. Then one of the bulls in a
separate corral shoved his head under the lower of the two log bars that fenced
him in and lifted&mdash;lifted,&mdash;but could not break through.</p>

<p>&#8220;Riding, old Scout?&#8221; Ted asked the young Spanish-Californian.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Fraid I&#8217;d ride the ground,&#8221; admitted Pedro, with a gesture of his
plump, manicured hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yeh!&mdash;Saw-horse&#8217;s HIS mount!&#8221; jollied Ace, though the pinto looked by
no means spiritless. (And to himself he added: &#8220;Likely promised his mother not
to. Gee! I&#8217;d like to <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4'></a>4</span>cut him loose from her apron strings for about
three months and see how he&#8217;d pan out!&#8221;)</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>He&#8217;s</i> got too much sense to risk his bones,&#8221; championed the
Senator, (a heavy, florid man with a leonine mass of white curly hair and Ace&#8217;s
daring black eyes).</p>

<p>Just then a petite young woman rode up, her bobbed curly hair and sun-flushed
cheeks topping a red silk blouse joined to her khaki riding breeches by a
fringed sash that reached half way to her elkskin boots.</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, Rosa, are you riding?&#8221; greeted Ace. The girl shook her head
merrily. &#8220;Dad, that&#8217;s Pierre La Coste&#8217;s sister,&mdash;you know, he&#8217;s fire-lookout
on Red Top. Used to be one of our Scouts when we lived in Peach Cove.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yeh, we used to call him Pur-r-r,&#8221; supplemented the ranch boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;And that&#8217;s the horse Ranger Radcliffe&#8217;s been trying to give her,&#8221; added
Ace, sotto voce. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t he a beauty?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And she won&#8217;t have him?&#8221; laughed the Senator.</p>

<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t have man or beast.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ace, now studying geology at the University <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5'></a>5</span>of California, though
he had traveled widely since the old ranch days, still counted Ted, sandy
haired, thin and freckled, struggling to make his mother&#8217;s fruit ranch a go, his
chum. Pedro, a neighbor of the old days, was his roommate in the fraternity
house at Berkeley. All three ran to greet Norris, a young man in the uniform of
the U. S. Geological Survey (son of the Forest Supervisor), who now appeared,
galloping beside Ranger Radcliffe. For he was to pilot them on a camping trip
into the high Sierras in a week or two.</p>

<p>The first entry was just being led forth to be saddled as the fifth and final
member of their expedition arrived on the scene, afoot,&mdash;Long Lester, a lanky,
bewhiskered old prospector in soft felt hat, clean but collarless &#8220;b&#8217;iled
shirt,&#8221; vest, cartridge belt and corduroy &#8220;pants,&#8221; thrust into the tops
of ordinary hob-nailed boots.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you broncho-busters, out in the center!&#8221; megaphoned the man on
the big bay. &#8220;Five more riders here!&mdash;Two-fifty to ride and seven-fifty more
to go up!&#8221; Three men came forward. &#8220;We want two more entries. If you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6'></a>6</span>pull-leather or fall off, two-fifty. If a fellow rides a bull with
one hand hold, he gets seven-fifty. Ten dollars if you go up!&#8221;</p>

<p>Ace and Ted exchanged glances as they started forward.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re sure courtin&#8217; trouble,&#8221; called the Senator.</p>

<p>&#8220;I reckon I am,&#8221; grinned Ted, &#8220;but I&#8217;m broke.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have to pay your winnings to get your bones mended.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take a chance!&#8221;</p>

<p>King laughed. Most of the horses he recognized as having been ridden before.
But he was secretly resolved if Ace drew a bad one, to exercise his parental
authority.</p>

<p>The chums drew from the hat, Ace taking the last name. He started as he
looked at his slip. &#8220;The white-faced bull,&#8221; read Ted over his shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee! Don&#8217;t tell Dad!&#8221; breathed Ace. &#8220;What&#8217;s yours?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Spitfire!&#8221;</p>

<p>The older boy emitted a long-drawn whistle.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, broncho boys,&#8221; megaphoned the starter.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7'></a>7</span>The first entry, rearing and snorting, with two lassos about his
neck, had finally been blind-folded and caparisoned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Johnny White from Fresno, on Old Ned from Northfork,&#8221; rang the
announcement. An Indian in overalls swung himself into the saddle simultaneously
with the snatching away of lassos and blinders.</p>

<p>The horse tucked his head almost between his knees, and leaped into the air,
bowing his back and grunting with each jump, while the dust rose till no one
could tell whether the rider was on or off. Then the horse galloped to the
opposite side of the corral and his unwelcome incumbent was perceived picking
himself sheepishly out of the dust.</p>

<p>&#8220;Henry Clark from Table Mountain, on the pinto from Cascada,&#8221; the next
entry was shortly announced. The Indian in the purple shirt stepped forward,
gorgeous in his borrowed chaps.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some buckaroo!&#8221; grinned Ted.</p>

<p>The pony, not quite so thin as most of the range stock, blinked startled
eyes, and the fire-works began. The gorgeous one, barely surviving the first
buck, and seeing himself riding <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8'></a>8</span>for a fall in all his finery, leapt
nimbly to the ground while the pony went on bucking. He landed right side
up&mdash;with no damage to the purple shirt. A derisive jeer greeted
this&mdash;fiasco.</p>

<p>&#8220;He sure wasn&#8217;t goin&#8217; to dust them ice-cream pants,&#8221; laughed one of the
crowd hanging over the fence. The Indian signified a desire to try again. After
a couple more riders were called, he was given the same mount again.</p>

<p>This time he saved his finery by grabbing hold with both hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pulling leather only gets two-fifty,&#8221; adjudged the megaphone man.</p>

<p>&#8220;He sure had a good hand hold,&#8221; gurgled Ted. &#8220;Pretty hard on the
wrists, isn&#8217;t it, Henry?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait till we get you a medal!&#8221; boomed Ace.</p>

<p>Next came a white rider, who won the nick-name &#8220;Easy Money&#8221; by riding a
mule up with a surcingle, then another Indian,&mdash;they were mostly the youngsters
working on local pack-trains,&mdash;who began by straddling the neck of his mount and
ended by going over the animal&#8217;s head, landing flat on his back. A momentary
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9'></a>9</span>hush, and the fence lizards began collecting around the limp form.
The Indian&#8217;s round brown face had turned gray.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stand back and give &#8217;m air,&#8221; megaphoned the starter, fanning him with
his hat. Some one brought water, then the Indian opened his eyes, and presently
signified a desire to get up. He was helped to his feet. &#8220;He&#8217;s all right,&#8221;
was the final verdict as the little group led off the field. &#8220;Somebody give
&#8217;m a cigarette.&#8221; The Indian leaned against the corral fence nonchalantly,
lighting up, though with fingers that shook the flame out of several
matches.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee!&#8221; nudged Ace. &#8220;Dad&#8217;s motioning us, and if he knows I&#8217;ve drawn
that bull, he&#8217;ll sure<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re nineteen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aw, he&#8217;s the Gov&#8217;ner, just the same. If you had one you&#8217;d see. Let&#8217;s stick
here behind this bunch till my turn comes &#8217;round.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure you&#8217;d better try it?&#8221; Ted laid a hand on his chum&#8217;s shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure thing! What&#8217;s the use of living if you never take a chance? Besides,
you&#8217;ve got a reg&#8217;lar rocking-horse yourself, huh?&#8221; he scoffed.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10'></a>10</span>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right, I was born ridin&#8217;,&#8221; Ted made light of
it.</p>

<p>It was now time for the bay bull. As a saddle swings around on anything but a
horse, it is easier to ride bulls and mules with a surcingle. It took three men
to get the bull into the saddling pen, two with lassos and one with a pole, but
the strap was finally adjusted around his chest, and the mount made.</p>

<p>One Shorty Somebody was the rider. And Shorty rode him,&mdash;stuck clear across
the corral. But there the bull torpedoed the middle log of the fence and went
straight through, scraping Shorty off.</p>

<p>Straight into a startled ring of spectators plowed the enraged beast, sending
horses whirling and pedestrians dodging for their lives. The petite Rosa&#8217;s mount
got to dancing, and finally staged a petite runaway on his own account, but Rosa
kept her head and a tight rein. A small boy scrambled into a low-branching tree.
But three lassos and a dozen mounted men finally headed off the bull and got him
into a smaller corral.</p>

<p>Ted looked inquiringly at Ace, but the Senator&#8217;s son evidently had his blood
up. The <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11'></a>11</span>white-faced bull, meantime, was again trying to thrust his
massive shoulders beneath the lower bar.</p>

<p>Two mules came next on the program, one rider bringing his mount to terms so
quickly that people were laying bets it was just a pack-mule, while the other
stuck when his jumped the fence.</p>

<p>Ranger Radcliffe, galloping back beside Rosa&#8217;s now docile mount, waved a hand
to the boys. Then a murmur rippled through the loungers that encircled the
corral, as the white-faced bull was called for. Ace&#8217;s nerves began to
tingle.</p>

<p>This bull had been kept in close confinement for several days past, and it
had not improved his temper. They had to throw him to put on the straps.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold him!&mdash;Hold him!&#8221; at intervals percolated through the hum of
voices, as the great brute lay panting in the saddling pen, his eyes ringed with
infuriated white, his snorting breath&mdash;audible thirty feet away&mdash;sending spirals
of dust scudding before his nose.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what do you say? Say it quick! I&#8217;m betting on the bull,&#8221; King was
challenging <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12'></a>12</span>the Ranger, little dreaming who the rider was to be.</p>

<p>This bull was to be ridden with a saddle and one hand hold. The gate of the
saddling pen cracked as its occupant tried to rise.</p>

<p>&#8220;You folks around the fence, you had better look out!&#8221; megaphoned the
starter. &#8220;This &#8217;ere bull may not look where he&#8217;s a-goin&#8217;!&#8221;</p>

<p>The gate cracked again. A woman nearby screamed. Two men with lassos ready
waited on either side, their mounts aquiver. Ace&#8217;s ruddy face had grown
strangely lined, but he stood his ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;The fellow that rides that bull is sure foolhardy,&#8221; the Senator was
remarking, pulling his hat further over his iron-gray brows against the slant of
the sun. Then the Ranger rode up with Rosa, and she was invited to a seat behind
the fluttering flag.</p>

<p>&#8220;Either that or almighty sandy,&#8221; amended Radcliffe.</p>

<p>Like a streak of lightning the bull arose, jaws slavering. One mighty crack
and he had burst the gate, a plunge and he was plowing his way across the field,
trailing a rope that still held his saddle horn. The starter raced after, his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13'></a>13</span>big bay holding back with all his might on the rope. The dust blew
chokingly into the faces of those on the Senator&#8217;s side of the corral. Then the
bull caught sight of that fluttering red, white and blue.</p>

<p>For one awful instant Rosa found those staring white-rimmed eyes glaring
straight into her own. The bull&#8217;s next leap would carry him over the fence and
into the machine. She blanched, but sat silent. Pedro, drawn up beside her on
his pinto, felt paralyzed. The Senator threw his engine on as if to back
away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold him!&mdash;HOLD him!&#8221; shrilled the starter, pounding back. The rope on
the saddle horn&mdash;would it hold? Then a lasso was thrown, tightening neatly
around the hind legs of the runaway.</p>

<p>&#8220;Got him stretched now!&#8221; came the triumphant shout, as the bull went
down with an infuriated snort, and lay there, chest heaving, while the vaqueros
made him fast.</p>

<p>&#8220;The ride&#8217;s off,&mdash;nobody goin&#8217; to ride <i>him</i> to-day!&#8221; decided the
man on the bay. The bull was relieved of his saddle and headed protestingly back
into the small corral.</p>

<p>Ace King&#8217;s face was set in deep lines. He <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14'></a>14</span>had been all nerved up
to his ride. Now that it was off, his knees felt shaky, and he climbed to a seat
on the top rail. And Pedro flushed to hide his pallor.</p>

<p>But Ted&#8217;s time was yet to come. One rider in between, whose horse piled him
on the ground, and the announcement came: &#8220;Ted Smith from Peach Cove, rides
Spitfire from Huntington Lake.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry for that kid,&#8221; stated Long Lester, who leaned lankily over
the gate, thumbs in the arm-holes of his vest. &#8220;Want up, little miss?&#8221; and
he helped a child to a vantage point beside him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go to it, old pal!&#8221; Ace thumped the contestant breath-takingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Spitfire! O-o-wah-hoo-o!&#8221; bellowed a group of cow-boys, in imitation of
the falsetto Indian yell.</p>

<p>&#8220;OO-wah-hoo-oo-oo!&#8221; the Indians bettered them.</p>

<p>Senator King honked in joyous abandon. Pedro&#8217;s dark eyes flashed. &#8220;Spunky
kid!&#8221; commented Radcliffe. &#8220;I&#8217;m betting he&#8217;ll ride him straight up!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll be killed!&#8221; Rosa shivered.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15'></a>15</span>&#8220;Not with those long legs to get a grip with,&#8221; the Ranger
reassured her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t that hoss a dinger!&#8221; admiringly Long Lester demanded of the
assemblage, as Spitfire danced forth with three lassos trying to hold him for
the blinders. Again he tried to climb the fence, eyes wide, nostrils
quivering.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m just itchin&#8217; to ride him,&#8221; Ted replied to Ace&#8217;s questioning gaze.
Every nerve in his wiry body was keyed electrically. Then the saddle was
adjusted, Ted was in the stirrups, and the blinder was jerked free.
&#8220;R-r-ready! Let &#8217;er go!&#8221; was megaphoned.</p>

<p>About that time things began to happen. Spitfire, as if feeling that his
reputation needed demonstrating, began to double in his best bucking form.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Ride</i> him, Ted!&#8221; yelled Ace. &#8220;Hey, Ted rides him, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Scratch him!&#8221; contributed Long Lester, who believed in spurs. &#8220;Say,
he&#8217;s a-scratchin&#8217; him up and down!&mdash;Ya-hooooooo!&#8221; as Ted rode him up again
and again, both arms free, slapping him hip and shoulder, hip and shoulder with
his sombrero. Zip!&mdash;<i>Zip!</i>&mdash;<span class='sc'>Zoom!</span>&mdash;Around and around they went,
the mustang <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16'></a>16</span>snorting loudly with each bounce, lathering in his
effort to unseat his rider. But Ted had grown to his back.</p>

<p>The broncho stopped, exhausted, flanks heaving.</p>

<p>&#8220;SOME riding!&#8221; gasped Pedro.</p>

<p>Then a shout went up. Ted was champion rider of the rodeo!</p>

<p>To the ranch boy&#8217;s amazement, he now found his long legs dangling from a seat
on the shoulders of his two college friends, while they marched about to the
tune of &#8220;A Jolly Good Fellow,&#8221;&mdash;Norris himself laughingly joining in the
chorus, and Long Lester thumping him breath-takingly between the shoulder
blades.</p>

<p>That was the day the camping trip had been planned. It was also the day Ace&#8217;s
little Spanish &#8217;plane, wirelessed from its hanger in Burlingame,[1] had given
them all a surprise, and a trial sail. The pilot arrived shivering in leather
jacket and heavy cap, woolen muffler and goggles, with similar wraps for Ace,
whose leather chaps now served a purpose. For the intense cold of the upper
levels it was necessary <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17'></a>17</span>for the pilot to lend his outer apparel, as
each of the prospective camp mates in turn took the observer&#8217;s seat, with Ace
piloting.</p>

<p>Ted was used to flying with him,&mdash;had, indeed, given him the nick-name which
all had now adopted, as a compliment to his exploits as a birdman. But to the
other three it was a new experience. He invited Norris first. Their route lay
like a map below them, as they winged their way across the sky, steering first
due South till the rim of King&#8217;s River Canyon threatened to suck them down into
its depths, then circling to the East till they could see Mt. Whitney rising
snow-capped above the surrounding peaks, and back to the waiting boys.</p>

<p>Long Lester ventured next, and as he afterwards expressed it, he thought he
was riding on the back of his neck as they soared into the blue deeps above
them, while the ocean of the atmosphere tossed them about capriciously. This
time Ace, running her into the cold strait above the river, headed her down
canyon to within a hundred feet of the forest top, his grit based on sound
mechanical training; his daring counterbalanced by his cool headed precision. He
tried no stunts, however, as he had promised <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18'></a>18</span>his father to indulge
in no aerial acrobatics under 1,000 feet. When they finally returned to terra
firma, right side up with care, the old prospector expressed himself as nowise
envious of Elijah.</p>

<p>Pedro belted himself in with a lack of enthusiasm that Long Lester did not
fail to note with sympathy, and away they soared, fearlessly on Ace&#8217;s part,
whose eyes, ears and lungs were in the pink of condition. But to the Spanish boy
came first a dizzy, seasick feeling, coupled with a conviction that he could not
draw breath against the head wind, then a chill that penetrated even the pilot&#8217;s
uniform, as he watched the earth recede beneath them. The motor purred as they
gained momentum and the propellers whirred noisily, and the changing air
pressures so affected the stability of the light craft that he felt half the
time as if they were lying over on their side. He also reflected that, should
the engine stall, their descent would be a matter of seconds only. In the dry
heat they had been traveling with what seemed terrific speed. He protested once,
but Ace did not hear him.</p>

<p>Then in the cold of the higher altitude, their <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19'></a>19</span>speed was reduced
and traveling was smoother. When at last the great white bird dropped back
almost on the spot from which they had started,&mdash;the distinguishing feat of the
Spanish &#8217;plane,&mdash;he was almost a convert, though as Lester said, &#8220;a little
green about the gills.&#8221; When later the opportunity came to try it again, he
abdicated in favor of Ted.</p>

<p>Norris assured them that there is air for 50 miles above the earth, and
sometimes a tidal wave of atmosphere reaching as high as 200 miles, though after
it gets about 190 degrees below zero, less is known about it. Its density is
reduced fully half at 18,000 feet,&mdash;half a mile above the highest peaks, like
Mt. Whitney, but though the air of high altitudes is more buoyant, the cold none
the less reduces the speed of the air cruiser.</p>

<p>While they were eating they discussed their itinerary.</p>

<p>Norris had the large trail maps of both Sierra and Sequoia National Forests.
These he laid out and pieced together into one big sheet ten feet long. On these
maps were marked out the good camp grounds, and where bears, or deer, quail or
grouse, might be found, <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20'></a>20</span>where supplies were obtainable, or pack and
saddle stock, guides and packers, or Forest ranger stations (little cabins
flying a flag from their peaks, to make them show up on the map).</p>

<p>There were the &#8220;roads passable for wagons,&#8221; &#8220;trails passable for pack
stock,&#8221; and &#8220;routes passable for foot travel only.&#8221; There were areas
marked with varying tiny green tufts of grass labeled &#8220;meadows where stock
grazing is permitted,&#8221; and &#8220;meadows where it is not permitted,&#8221;
&#8220;meadows fenced for the free use of the traveling public&#8221; and &#8220;meadows
fenced for the use of Forest Rangers only.&#8221;</p>

<p>Diminutive green pine trees indicated forest areas particularly interesting,
striped red areas signalized National Forest timber sales, cut over or in
operation, black triangles denoted Forest Service fire outlook stations, and a
drawing that looked like a woodshed showed where Forest Service fire fighting
tools had been cached in various out-of-the-way places. &#8220;TLP&#8221; indicated the
free Government telephone boxes, red doughnutty-looking circles meant good
mountains to climb, with some indication of the safest routes to the top, areas
marked out in red diamonds were labeled as <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21'></a>21</span>geographically
interesting, and those in green as botanically of more than ordinary
interest.</p>

<p>A green feathery-looking line meant a canyon, a green triangle a waterfall, a
plain green line a stream offering good fishing, and a broken green line a
stream stocked with young fish, while an X meant a barrier impassable by fish,
though what that meant, not one of them could say.</p>

<p>There were various other marks, such as a hub surrounded by the spokes of a
wheel (whatever it was intended for), the key to which explained that from that
point a good view was to be obtained.</p>

<p>But what most attracted their attention, all up and down the crest of the
Sierra Nevada as it stretched from North, North-West to South, South-East, were
the wide green areas &#8220;of special scenic interest,&#8221; most of which was marked
&#8220;UNEXPLORED!&#8221; in great warning red letters.</p>

<p>It was this part of the map that most fascinated the little camping party.
Why should they choose a route that was all cut and dried for them, as it
were,&mdash;where each day they would know when they started out just about
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22'></a>22</span>where night would find them and what they would meet with on the
way? Who wanted their views labeled anyway? That was all very well, very
thoughtful of the Forest Service, for inexperienced campers, who would probably
never venture into the unknown. But to Ace, the airman, to Ted, with his
experienced wild-craft, and to Pedro the romanticist, no less than to the young
Yale man whose thirst for far places had led him into the U. S. Geological
Survey, the Mystery of the Unexplored called, with a lure that was not to be
denied. Long Lester, they knew, was game for anything,&mdash;for had he not
prospected through these mountains all his life? There was practically no place
the sure-footed burros could not go, and there was no danger they were not
secretly and wickedly tingling to encounter.</p>

<p>It was a wild region, as rough and as little known as anything from Hawaii to
Alaska,&mdash;only different. The John Muir Trail, named for the explorer,&mdash;a &#8220;way
through&#8221; rather than a trail,&mdash;stretched along the crest of the range, the
roughest kind of going, (absolutely a horse-back trip, it was generally
pronounced), and from its glacier-capped peaks, from 14,500 foot <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23'></a>23</span>Mt.
Whitney, to the even more difficult though less lofty Lyell, ran the Kings&#8217;
River, North, Middle, and canyoned South Forks, the Kern and the Kaweah, the
Merced and the San Joaquin,&mdash;to name only the largest.</p>

<p>Unlike the older Eastern ranges, the Sierra is laid out with remarkable
regularity, the one great 12,000- to 14,000-foot divide, with its scarcely lower
passes, giving off ridges on the Western slope like the teeth of a coarse
granite comb. Between ridges, deep, glacier-cut canyons, &#8220;yo-semities,&#8221; (to
employ the Indian name), with their swift, cascading rivers make North to South
travel difficult, though one can follow one side of the openly forested canyons
to the very crest of the main ridge.</p>

<p>Here and there was a grove of Big Trees, varying in size from the Giant
Forest of Sequoia National Park to the few mediocre specimens at Dinkey Creek.
But as a rule the hot, irrigated valleys of the Sacramento and San Joaquin gave
way to patches of the small oaks and pines of the foothills, and these in turn,
several thousand feet higher up the Western slopes, to yellow pine and incense
cedar, Sequoias and giant sugar pines. Higher still <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24'></a>24</span>came the silver
fir belt, and after that, the twisted Tamaracks and dwarfed and storm-tossed
mountain pines, reaching often in at least a decorative fringe along the rock
cracks to the very peaks, all the way up to 12,000 feet. (Tree line in the White
Mountains of New Hampshire comes soon after 5,000.) Above that, of course, only
snow and ice could clothe the slopes.</p>

<p>Hell-for-Sure Pass was one name that attracted Ace&#8217;s eye on the map. He
judged that it must mean stiff going,&mdash;but even had they actually planned to
climb that way, he would have preferred to wait and discover for himself the
reason for its nomenclature. There was also Deadman Pass, (another name to
tickle the imagination), Electra Peak, Thousand Island Lake, The Devil&#8217;s Post
Pile, Volcanic Ridge, Crater Creek, Stairway Creek, Fawn Meadow,&mdash;and
dangerously near, Bear Meadow,&mdash;Vermilion Cliffs, Piute Pass, Disappearing
Creek, Lost Canyon, Table Mountain, (reminiscent of the Bret Harte days),
Deadman Canyon, (flavoring more strongly of the gold days of &#8217;49), and
Rattlesnake Creek, (doubtless deserving the title.)&mdash;To say nothing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25'></a>25</span>of such ordinary features as 13,500 foot University Peak, (a mere
wave of the sea of peaks surrounding champions Lyell and Whitney), Diamond Peak,
13,000 feet, Mt. Baxter, likewise around 13,000, Mt. Pinchot, and a score of
others (occurring at short intervals in a solid phalanx). Whoever wants to
climb a mountain everybody climbs, seemed to be the final verdict of the party.
There are other peaks almost as high as Whitney, (certainly quite high enough to
suit the most fastidious sportsman), and probably even more difficult of ascent.
Why not discover something new under the sun? In other words, why not strike off
at random into the Unexplored? They would head right into the thick of the
thickest green patch on the map, and wander as fancy dictated. If they felt like
climbing, they would climb. If they felt like lazing, (as Pedro put it), they
would laze. If they came to a river they could cross, all right. If they could
not cross, why, all right, who cared?</p>

<p>There was rumor of vast caves that riddled the back country. There were hot
springs, soda springs,&mdash;who knew what? Good pasturage was never hard to find.
The verdant meadows <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26'></a>26</span>left by the glacier lakes could be counted on up
to the very backs of the 9,000 foot ridges. Most of them were half to a mile
wide, and at the head waters of the big rivers, they had heard, were meadows
nearer ten miles in length.</p>

<p>With one exception, every lake in the Sierras is a glacier lake (that
exception being Huntington, a &#8220;made&#8221; lake four miles long that falls three
thousand feet through a flume to add power to an electric plant). These lakes
lie all the way up to as high as 8,000 feet above sea-level, Norris&#8217;s theory
being that in time they will be found higher still. The glaciers left by the
last ice age naturally melted first in the lower reaches, and as those that now
cap the peaks and flow down between ridges like the arms of a starfish, melt in
their turn, they will leave their icy, green-blue crystal pools higher and
higher up the mountainsides. Just North of Mt. Ritter, Norris told them, lies a
glacier lake at an altitude of 12,000 feet, while the glaciers still to be found
are slowly, slowly grinding out the basins of the lakes that will one day,
(possibly centuries hence), lie where now linger these evidences of the last
glacier epoch.</p>

<p>Where these lakes have in their turn disappeared <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27'></a>27</span>they have left
these rich-soiled meadows. Where these level-lying meadows failed them pasturage
for their burros, Norris guaranteed that there would be plenty of hanging
meadows,&mdash;long, narrow, bowldery strips of weed enameled verdure slanting up and
down the moraine-covered canyon sides, beginning away up at timber line, where
springs the source of their life-giving moisture.</p>

<p>Before the group broke up that day, word came that Rosa&#8217;s brother had broken
his leg, there at the fire outlook on Red Top. (A pack-mule had crowded his
horse off the trail on the steep slope of an arroyo, and the horse had fallen,
though breaking his otherwise sure descent into the creek below by coming
sharply up against a tree trunk.)</p>

<p>&#8220;The worst of it is,&#8221; worried Radcliffe, &#8220;with men so scarce, I don&#8217;t
know who to send in his place. Besides, it&#8217;s a week&#8217;s horseback trip from
here,&mdash;and fires breaking every day,&mdash;and he needs a doctor.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was not till the deed was done that Ace returned to announce, with the
smile of the cat who has licked the cream, that Rosa had insisted on taking her
brother&#8217;s place. He, Ace, <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28'></a>28</span>had found the spot from her sure knowledge
of the topography of the place. (She had kept house there for her brother the
summer before, in the wee, wind-swept cabin.) And leaving Rosa there, as she
pluckily insisted, Ace brought her brother back, covering in minutes, as the
bird flies, what it would have taken a week to traverse on horseback. Those
mountain trails corkscrew up and down the canyon sides till instead of calling a
certain distance a hundred miles according to the map, one states it, &#8220;a week
into the back-country,&#8221;&mdash;or in the case of the trailless peaks, (among which
Long Lester felt most at home), the same distance might be a matter of a
four-weeks&#8217; camping trip, with no human habitation, and the likelihood of not
even a ranch at which to purchase supplies, in between.</p>

<p>Then the Senator sent the &#8217;plane back to San Francisco, and its hangar in
Burlingame, before&mdash;as he said&mdash;his young hopeful could start anything more. He
himself was to spend the next month fishing around Kings&#8221; River Canyon,
putting up at the canvas hotel. But he took as much interest in the camping trip
as if he had been a member of it,&mdash;as, indeed, did <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29'></a>29</span>Ranger Radcliffe,
though word of a fresh forest fire breaking cut short his part in the
powwow.</p>

<p>The question now arose, should they go horseback, or afoot with
pack-burros,&mdash;a string of which Long Lester yearned to pilot.</p>

<p>True, a mountain-bred pony will hop and slide up and down mountain ledges
that would make an Eastern horse&#8217;s hair literally stand on end. They have been
born and bred to it, physically and mentally. They have been known to sit back
almost on their haunches and slide when they could get down no other way. Some
of them will walk a log twenty feet above the surface of a stream. (The Eastern
rider will find that hard to believe, until he recalls the feats of circus
horses.) But not all horses are alike, any more than people. Why should the
plains horse and the park horse and good old Dobbin, the farm horse, be equine
mountaineers and prospectors?</p>

<p>&#8220;Shank&#8217;s horses&#8221; and the pack-burros won the final ballot,&mdash;to Pedro&#8217;s
open dismay. But they would first ride the well-defined two-days&#8217; horseback
trail from Giant Forest to the Kings&#8217; River Canyon, and Giant Forest is an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30'></a>30</span>automobile stage ride from Fresno, which is another short day&#8217;s ride
from Huntington Lake.</p>

<p>(Strange are the threads of destiny! Not one of that group so much as dreamed
that they were embarking on anything but a five weeks&#8217; camping trip.)</p>

<p class='cln0'>CHAPTER II</p>
<p class='cln1'>THE CAMPING TRIP</p>
</div>

<p>A week later Morris and the boys arrived at the lumber camp on the Canyon
rim, where they were to await Long Lester,&mdash;Ace in a piratical and plutocratic
black Stetson sombrero, hiking boots and flannel shirt, a red bandanna at his
throat, and to supplement his khaki riding breeches he had bestowed lovingly in
his duffle bag the Mexican leather chaps. He also displayed the eight-inch
leather belt of the cow country, and elbow length leather cuffs studded with
silver nails.</p>

<p>Ted let it go at his second best blue overalls and heavy shoes, a green plaid
gingham shirt, with a brown one to change off and straw hat. Pedro lounged
gracefully about in corduroy trousers and elkskin boots, (which Norris warned
him would last about a week on such rough going), and a wool jersey in the same
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32'></a>32</span>soft tan. He took their guying good naturedly, however, and in
mockery of Ace&#8217;s more picturesque accoutrement, gave a first class imitation of
a motion picture director with the Senator&#8217;s son for his prize Bad Man. Norris
wore his second best uniform, and all had sweaters and a change of socks and
things, to say nothing of an extra pair of shoes.</p>

<p>When word came that the old guide had had &#8220;some investment business&#8221;
come up to delay him, they decided to establish a make-shift camp. There was not
one chance in a hundred of any rain, but they decided a lean-to would be
convenient anyway. They got some shakes of an old lumberman whose function it
was to split the giant shingles from three foot lengths of log.</p>

<p>Four poles for corner-posts made a substantial beginning. Smaller ones
morticed to lie crosswise gave something to which to nail the shakes, which were
overlapped shingle-fashion on both sides and roof. The tarpaulins would make a
curtain across the front. The floor was bedded down a foot deep with springy
silver fir boughs, laid butts down and toward the foot. <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33'></a>33</span>To this
could be added fresh browse as it grew dry and harsh.</p>

<p>Tables were made by borrowing a saw of the lumbermen and slicing a four foot
log into eight inch slices, then gouging these out on the under side so that
stout legs could be fitted in. Stools were made from short lengths of a smaller
log, and behold! the open air dining-room and kitchen were furnished, at cost of
a few hours&#8217; fun.</p>

<p>Norris even made a sort of steamer chair of poles, using a double thickness
of his tarp for the seat and back.</p>

<p>Next came a stone fireplace, with an old piece of sheet iron across the top,
and a great flat hearth-stone on which to warm the plates.</p>

<p>Each tin can as it was opened had its top neatly removed and was washed and
set aside as a chipmunk-proof container, and Pedro fashioned a refrigerator by
replacing the two sides of a cracker box with screen wire, (bartered from the
cook of the lumber camp), hinging the door with discarded shoe tongues.</p>

<p>Cord was strung for clothes-line, and a supply of several kinds of fuel
brought in. The down <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34'></a>34</span>logs were simply run into the fireplace, butt
ends first, and shoved closer as they burned. Ted devised a rake for gathering
together the dry twigs and cones and bark with which the ground was strewn, by
using nails for teeth, set in a small board fastened at an angle to the stick
that served as handle.</p>

<p>Following Norris&#8217;s lead, each fellow heated water and took a sponge bath
daily, (except Ace, who took a cold plunge in the glacier-cold stream), and
afterwards washed out his change of socks and underwear and his towel. The
dish-washers also laundered the dish towels after each meal. That way,
everything was always ship-shape. And, be it noted, any cook who burned the
nested aluminum pans and kettles had to clean them himself, and though Norris
had made that easier by bringing along a box of fine steel-wool, it was amazing
how few scorched dishes occurred! Of course where pots were used over the fire,
the outsides got sooty, but after all, it was only the insides that affected
one&#8217;s health.</p>

<p>The boys found that they slept warmer by doubling their blankets into
sleeping bags, pinning them shut with horse-blanket safety-pins,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35'></a>35</span>with their tarps for a windproof outer layer. And many&#8217;s the
sleeping bag race they ran,&mdash;or rather, hopped, to the amazement, no doubt, of
the wild folk who very likely watched from the shadows. Agile Ted won the grand
prize at one of these stunts by hopping the full length of a fallen log in his
bag, without once falling off.</p>

<p>There were also pine-cone battles and bait-casting contests, Pedro excelling
in the throw by reason of his big arm muscles. Thus day succeeded cool and
perfect day, and night followed star-strewn night, for nearly a week. The
tooth-brush brigade sallied forth as soon as the sun began slanting its long
morning rays through the forest aisles, and the boys often began nodding at a
ridiculously early hour around the bon-fire, tired from their strenuous day in
the open. But each day found their spirits higher, their muscles harder, their
eyes brighter,&mdash;and their appetites more insatiable. Ted was plumping up and
Pedro trimming down on the self-same medicine.</p>

<p>The chipmunks soon became so tame that they ran all over the place, over the
boys&#8217; feet, on up to their shoulders, and into their pockets <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36'></a>36</span>for the
goodies they sometimes found. But they never ran under any one&#8217;s palm. Pedro
got one cornered and caught him with his bare hands, and put him on a leash, but
the furry mite spent the next half hour straining to get away, too unhappy to
eat,&mdash;cowering, trembling, when the boys stroked his orange striped back with a
gentle finger,&mdash;and Pedro finally gave him back his freedom, (and a pyramid of
peanuts).</p>

<p>&#8220;Camp Chipmunk&#8221; it was finally voted to call the place, and the name was
inscribed on the side of a huge fallen log with bits of yellow-green live
moss.</p>

<p>Though the chipmunks could easily have gone to the creek, as they must have
before the boys came, they displayed a preference for drinking out of the same
water pail the boys did, and they sometimes took an unexpected and unappreciated
plunge bath.</p>

<p>Besides the very tiny chipmunks, there were some of the ground-squirrel size
with the same orange and black. They were duller of wit, and more timid, but
they used to chase the little fellows to within an inch of their lives. One day
a big Sayes chipmunk attempted to fish a cheese <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37'></a>37</span>rind out of the
fireplace. The ashes were still hot, and he plunged into the soft stuff over his
head, he was out and away, with a piercing squeal, almost instantly, trailing
white ash behind him.</p>

<p>The boys used to bury nuts just to see how fast the littlest chipmunks would
smell them out. After repeatedly finding the Dutch oven bread nibbled around the
edges, Pedro hung the bread-bag from the clothes-line one night. He was awakened
next morning by the shout Ted sent up when he found two chipmunks running down
the string and squeezing their way delightedly into the bag.</p>

<p>Some one always had to watch while the meal was being laid, for the mouselike
villains would be right up on the table sampling the butter, if some one did not
keep an eye out. Or they would climb up the leg of the table and peek over the
edge with their beady eyes, wondering how far they dared approach without danger
to their agile persons. But the funniest thing was when two chipmunks would
quarrel,&mdash;as generally happened when one unearthed a nut that another had
buried. Nickering in the angriest way imaginable, the two tiny things would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38'></a>38</span>come at each other with ears laid back, in what appeared for all the
world like a head-butting contest. Around and around they would whirl in a
spiral nebula, till one got a head start on a race for home and mother.</p>

<p>Each morning they awoke to the hack-hack-hack of the sawyers and the steady
grating of the log saw, the twitter of the donkey engine and the volcanic
remarks with which the bull-puncher was urging his team forward. The yellow
sunshine sifted aslant through the giant trees, birds sang, and chipmunks
chattered. A water-packer passed them one day with his mule plodding along under
40 gallons disposed in canvas bags on a wooden frame, and beyond, across the
singing creek, they could see the swampers burning the brush they had cut from
the pathway of the tree next to fall.</p>

<p>Breakfast dispatched, the boys hurried over to watch the two-bitted axe
biting its huge kerf in the side of a ten-foot trunk. When it had eaten a third
of the way through the giant trunk, the sawyers began on the opposite side,
nearly as high as the top of the kerf, resting the long instrument on pegs
driven into two holes that had been bored for the purpose. <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39'></a>39</span>Iron
wedges were driven after the saw. The instant the tree began to lean, the head
chopper had driven a stake about 150 feet from the base on the side of the kerf,
declaring that the falling tree would drive that stake into the ground, so
accurately could they gauge the direction of its fall. The swampers had cleared
the way between. Then came the cracking of neighboring branches, as the mammoth
trunk swayed and toppled to the forest floor. There was a crash that shook the
ground, which rebounded with a shower of chips and bark dust, and the stump
gaped raw and red where for perhaps 2,000 years it had upborne the plumed
Sequoia Gigantea.</p>

<p>The boys, far above whose heads the fallen trunk towered, scrambled up the
rough bark and raced each other up and down the novel roadway that it made.
Then, the excitement over, they suddenly realized that they were hungry and ran
another race back to camp.</p>

<p>Later they watched as the donkey engine, stronger than ten oxen, was made
fast to a stump and stoked till it could move itself into position to haul the
log lengths to the waiting ox team. Peelers with axes and long steel bars
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40'></a>40</span>had been peeling off the thick red bark, which the boys found could
be whittled into odd shapes and rubbed velvety at the cut ends. The sawyers were
sawing the trunk into lengths short enough to ride on box cars, and the chain
tenders were driving the &#8220;dogs&#8221; or steel hooks into the forward segment
preparatory to attaching the chain that was to draw the log after the panting
donkey engine. The block shifter was ready with his pulley, and the gypsy tender
was gathering down wood.</p>

<p>Suddenly, just as the chain had stretched till the log began to move, some
weak link snapped and with a rebound like that of a cannon it flashed over the
hillside, catching one man and toppling him over with a broken leg. The camp
cook, whose accomplishments varied from the ability to deliver an impromptu and
usually unsolicited sermon to that of calling off the numbers at a stag dance,
was summoned in haste and from a long black bag that went with the framed
diploma that hung at the head of his bunk, this unusual individual administered
surgical treatment. The injured man took it philosophically,&mdash;his out of door
constitution would repair the damage with more than average
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41'></a>41</span>speed,&mdash;and the work of getting out the big log proceeded as
before.</p>

<p>They also watched, fascinated, as the logs at a camp further back were sent
down a crude slide that slanted sheer to a sizeable lake. Ace threatened to try
riding a log some time, but Norris rendered one of his rare ultimatums on that
score.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s take plenty to eat!&#8221; bargained Pedro, who was beginning to
suspect it was no afternoon stroll he had embarked upon. &#8220;Hadn&#8217;t we better
&#8217;phone old Lester to lay in some extra supplies?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is always fish,&#8221; Norris reminded him.</p>

<p>&#8220;One gets tired of fish. I say let&#8217;s take plenty of grub, if we&#8217;re going
away off where for weeks we may not see a living soul to buy a pound of bacon
of. Eating&#8217;s half the fun of camping. And if we get up there on the John Muir
Trail, we can&#8217;t even catch fish, can we&mdash;always?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the stuff!&#8221; seconded Ace. &#8220;If we aren&#8217;t tied too tightly to
the problem of rustling grub, we will be freer to roam where we please. But
gosh! Won&#8217;t it take a whole <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42'></a>42</span>train-load of burros to pack enough
stuff? Five men, three times a day, that&#8217;s fifteen meals. And thirty days would
make it 450 meals. Besides we&#8217;ll eat just about double the normal number of
calories,&mdash;the way I feel already. And twice 450 meals is 900.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whoa, there!&#8221; begged Norris. &#8220;How much can a burro carry, anyway? We
can&#8217;t take all our food, or we&#8217;ll have such a pack-train we won&#8217;t have time for
anything but donkey driving, and if we carry feed to keep them going on the
trail, we&#8217;ll have to take more burros to pack the feed, and they will have to
have feed too, and&mdash;there&#8217;s no end to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, of course we&#8217;ll fish, when we can,&#8221; amended Pedro. &#8220;And we can
take compact rations, dried stuff, instead of watery canned goods. They&#8217;re just
as good, aren&#8217;t they? Only the water&#8217;s been taken out of them, and we can put it
back in each night before we eat it. What&#8217;s the use of packing tin cans that are
mostly full of water?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t call canned peaches mostly water,&#8221; retorted Ace, who though
less dependent than the plumper Pedro on his three square <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43'></a>43</span>meals per
day, was even more particular what those three meals tasted like.</p>

<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t only the juice,&#8221; said Pedro. &#8220;The peaches themselves are
half water. Dried peaches are the same thing except for that, and two pounds of
dried peaches will go a whole heap farther than a two-pound can, let me tell
you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Ace. &#8220;Dried peaches! What else? Mr. Norris, you&#8217;ve
had a lot of experience on these back-country trips.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m!&#8221; said the young Survey man, his eyes lighting reminiscently.
&#8220;Did you ever eat black bean soup with salt pork and garlic to flavor
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have,&#8221; said Pedro. &#8220;It&#8217;s a meal in itself, with black rye bread and
dill pickle. And what about fried frogs&#8217; legs and watercress? Broiled mushrooms,
stewed mushrooms and onions, and crayfish soup?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sounds good to me,&#8221; Ace admitted. &#8220;But have we a mushroom expert in
our midst? I&#8217;m not ready to commit suicide just yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor I,&#8221; laughed Norris.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nobody asked you to,&#8221; Pedro looked aggrieved. <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44'></a>44</span>&#8220;Goodness
knows I&#8217;m no expert, but I do know a few kinds, and I know those few kinds for
sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hot dog!&#8221; commented the Senator&#8217;s son. &#8220;Go to it, ol&#8217; boy!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; Norris continued, &#8220;there&#8217;ve been times in my life when I
didn&#8217;t turn up my nose at corned beef hash browned.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And spuds!&#8221; Ace completed the recipe. &#8220;And onions.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dehydrated,&#8221; Norris admitted. &#8220;Can&#8217;t carry potatoes for more than the
first few days, and dried onion is just as flavorful as fresh.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An onion a day&mdash;&#8221; began Ace.</p>

<p>&#8220;Keeps everybody away,&#8221; finished the young Survey man laughingly. &#8220;And
that reminds me of apples,&mdash;dried apple pie, apple pudding, apple dumplings,
(baked or boiled), apple fritter, (made with pancake flour), and apple pan-dowdy
with cinnamon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pan-dowdy!&#8221; queried both boys.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, when the cook has to roll it out with a bottle, or an oar handle, or
a smooth stone instead of a rolling pin, and perhaps bake it in the frying pan,
and he hesitates to label the result, he terms it pan-dowdy, and then nobody
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45'></a>45</span>has any kick coming if it isn&#8217;t exactly flesh, fish or fowl, if you
get me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We get you!&#8221; grinned Ted, who had thus far been a silent partner to the
plans. But as usually happened at such times, he had been doing a lot of
thinking. He now added his contribution: &#8220;How about rainbow trout broiled with
pork scraps, and served with horseradish? Let&#8217;s take a bottle of
horseradish.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dried horseradish and a grater,&#8221; amended Pedro.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right. Then there&#8217;s trout baked with tomato and onion sauce, trout
baked in clay, trout boiled for a change, with lemon, (we could start the trip
with a few), trout skewered, griddled, baked in ashes, baked on a stone,
fried&mdash;of course, and roasted and stuffed with sage. Let&#8217;s take sage. Then how
about cold boiled trout salad with mustard dressing, and fish chowder a la
canned milk, with dry-dated&mdash;what do you call it? De-hydrated potatoes and
evaporated onions? Eh? And garlic isn&#8217;t such a bad idea. It&#8217;s the handiest
little bit of flavoring I know of,&mdash;if we all go in for it alike.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll all go in for it good and strong,&#8221; winked Ace.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46'></a>46</span>&#8220;Strong is the word,&#8221; chuckled Norris.</p>

<p>&#8220;Anyway,&#8221; Ted defended his suggestion. &#8220;I&#8217;ve camped through the
back-country a heap in my time, and I&#8217;ve generally found it isn&#8217;t the sameness
of the fish-three-times-a-day that lays you out, but the lack of flavorings. Now
I even take caraway seed to give a different flavor to a batch of biscuit, and
raisins, or some anise seed, or a little strong cheese, that you can grate into
it or on it and then toast it till it melts. Then there&#8217;s cinnamon and cheese
toast for dessert, and plain cinnamon and sugar melted on white bread makes it
just bully! And why do we have to eat white bread all the time anyway?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course we&#8217;ll have cornmeal and buckwheat in our pancake mixture,&#8221;
said Norris.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bully! But why not take part rye flour too, and part oatmeal to mix in? It
bakes fine and flaky. And there&#8217;s oatmeal cookies mixed with peanut butter and
sweetened!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; Norris pronounced.</p>

<p>&#8220;Y&#8217;r <i>all right</i>, kid!&#8221; Ace thumped affectionately on his thin
shoulder blade, &#8220;y&#8217;r all right,&#8221; but at the threatened repetition of the
bearlike caress, Ted dodged.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47'></a>47</span>&#8220;Another idea,&#8221; Pedro broke in. &#8220;Why eat bread all the
time anyway? Why not macaroni and cheese, and spaghetti and tomato
paste?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And garlic?&#8221; teased Ace.</p>

<p>&#8220;Surest thing you know! And vermicelli, and noodles, and all those things.
They&#8217;re all made of flour, and they&#8217;re different.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A little bulky,&#8221; protested Norris.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, well, for the start of the trip, then. They&#8217;re not so heavy, parked up
on top of a burro&#8217;s regular pack.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; agreed the leader of the expedition. &#8220;We may come to cattle
ranches where we can get beef and mutton occasionally, though not after we get
into the higher altitudes. And we can start off with a few fresh eggs, for
compactness and safety broken a dozen at a time into glass jars. After that&mdash;I
don&#8217;t know whether you fellows would like scrambled eggs or not, made of egg
powder. Personally I don&#8217;t. Nor the famous erbswurst.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aw!&#8221; drawled Ted, barely concealing his impatience. &#8220;The thing that
stands by you best on a hard trip, after all, is jerky and pemmican. I think old
Lester jerked some venison himself last fall, and he&#8217;s probably got it yet. And
he&#8217;ll <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48'></a>48</span>grind us some pemmican, if we get him word before he
starts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee Whiz! Those are emergency rations!&#8221; vetoed Ace.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have to have a long distance conversation with him to-night,&#8221;
said Norris. &#8220;Meantime we mustn&#8217;t forget pilot biscuit and peanut butter for a
pocket lunch and shelled peanuts, of course, and rice, and tea and coffee, and
sugar, and baking powder.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There are two things that can compactly,&#8221; conceded the Castilian boy at
this point. &#8220;The best grade of canned beets and spinach are pretty solid
weight. I&#8217;ll make no kick if we load on some of that until we get to the steeper
grades.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hey!&#8221; shouted Ace. &#8220;In all this time nobody&#8217;s mentioned
bacon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We took that for granted,&#8221; laughed Norris. &#8220;I&#8217;ll bet Long Lester
would never start out without it, whether we told him to or not. But I&#8217;m awfully
afraid we&#8217;ll use more tea than coffee. It&#8217;s bulky, and worse, it loses
flavor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said Ted, &#8220;I know the answer to that. Powdered coffee isn&#8217;t one
quarter so bulky, and <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49'></a>49</span>put up in little separate tins, we keep
opening them fresh, don&#8217;t you see?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve never yet seen a powdered coffee that could compare with the real
thing,&#8221; Ace complained.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why couldn&#8217;t Les buy the real thing and then get it powdered and sealed
into little separate tins for us?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He could,&#8221; agreed Norris, &#8220;I suppose,&mdash;if we&#8217;re going to be as fussy
as all that.&#8221; (Ace flushed.) &#8220;But with our woods&#8217; appetites<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, and citric acid tablets,&#8221; the Senator&#8217;s son hastened to change the
subject. &#8220;For lemonade, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>The discussion was cut short by Pedro&#8217;s discovery that a bear had invaded the
lean-to.</p>

<p>The American black bear, and his California cousin whose coat has generally
lightened to the cinnamon brown of the soil, is all but tame in the National
Parks, where for years he has been unmolested. A friendly fellow even in the
wild state,&mdash;for the most part,&mdash;he roams the Giant Forest as much a prized part
of the landscape as the Big Trees themselves. He has learned to visit the
garbage dump regularly <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50'></a>50</span>every night, and it causes no sensation
whatever to meet one on the trail. It was much the same about the lumber
camp.</p>

<p>But to have him visit uninvited, and serve his own refreshments from their
selected stores, was a less attractive trick. Nor did he show the slightest
inclination to take alarm and vacate when the boys returned. On the contrary, he
snarled and showed his teeth when they would have driven him from the maple
sugar can, and even Ace felt at the moment that discretion was in order. It was
not till Old Shaggy-Sides had pretty well demolished everything in sight, and
then carried the ham off under his arm, that he took a reluctant departure.</p>

<p>This would never do. That night the unprotected edibles were hoisted just too
high for a possible visitor to reach, on a rope slung over the limb of a tree.
The boys still slept under the stars, for they knew enough about bears, (all but
Pedro), not to be afraid. Pedro, however, got little sleep that night, though he
would not have confessed to the fact for anything on earth.</p>

<p>&#8220;There was one bear in Sequoia Park,&#8221; remembered <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51'></a>51</span>Ace, &#8220;who
got too fresh, that way, and raided some one&#8217;s tent, and they had to send for
help to get him out. When it happened half a dozen times, he was ordered shot.
But he was the only one I&#8217;ve ever heard of acting that way. Now I&#8217;ll bet, if
we&#8217;d inquire, we&#8217;d find this bear had been half tamed, and altogether spoiled by
these lumbermen.</p>

<p>&#8220;We were driving through Yellowstone last summer when one of those half
tame bears came out to beg. We stopped the machine and I fed him some candy.
Then we parked, and went up to the hotel for dinner. When we came back, we found
he had mighty near clawed the back seat to pieces,&mdash;and why do you suppose?&mdash;To
get at a side of bacon we had stowed away in there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did he find it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We never did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That reminds me of something I heard,&#8221; laughed Norris. &#8220;Some friends
of mine in Sequoia left their lunch boxes in the machine while they went to
climb Moro Rock. When they came back they found a cub calmly sitting up there
behind the wheel, eating one lunch after another.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52'></a>52</span>Pedro was in for moving their headquarters to a great hollow Big
Tree, the cavity in which was as large as a good sized room, with a Gothic sort
of opening they could have made a door for. But the very next morning the old
prospector arrived with the train of pack-burros, and they were off.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you explain the Sequoias, Mr. Norris? Will we find more of
them?&#8221; asked Pedro, with a last wistful backward glance.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Big Trees are by no means confined to Sequoia National Park and other
well known groves,&#8221; said the Survey man. &#8220;The Sequoia gigantea is to be
found in scattered groves for a distance of 250 miles or more, up and down the
West slope of the Sierras, at altitudes just lower than that of the belt of
silver firs,&mdash;that is, anywhere from 5,000 to 8,000 feet above sea level. And in
fact, south of Kings&#8217; River, the Sequoias stretch in an almost unbroken forest
for seventy miles. Nor are they all of the proportions so often cited, where a
man standing at their base looks like a fly on the wall by comparison with these
prehistoric giants. Nor did they all get their start in life 4,000 years ago.
There are young trees in plenty, saplings and <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53'></a>53</span>seedlings, who will
doubtless reach the patriarchal stage some 4,000 years hence. On what kind of
earth will they look then? On what stage in the evolution of civilization? Will
another ice age have re-carved these mountains? And how will man have learned to
protect himself from the added severity of those winters?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It certainly gives one something to think about,&#8221; mused Pedro. &#8220;It is
only in these younger specimens that you can see what a graceful tree it is!&#8221;
He glanced from a feathery Big Tree youngster of perhaps 500 summers, with its
slender branches drooping in blue-green plumes toward the base, with
purple-barked limbs out-thrust on the horizontal half way up, and at the top
reaching ardently heavenward. Near it stood a parent tree of perhaps middle age,
born around the time of Christ, whose crown was still firmly rounded with the
densely massed foliage, now yellow-brown, and the bark red-brown.</p>

<p>The millions of two inch cones, surprisingly tiny for such a tree, hang heavy
with seeds,&mdash;they counted 300 in a single green cone.</p>

<p>&#8220;With such millions of seeds,&#8221; puzzled Pedro, &#8220;I should think the
trees would grow so <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54'></a>54</span>thick that there would be no walking between
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Norris. &#8220;In the first place, remember that not one seed in
a million escapes these busy Douglas squirrels and the big woodcocks that you
hear drumming everywhere. Then even the millionth seed has to risk forest fires
and snow-slides, lumbermen and lightning. But I&#8217;ll tell you something funny
about them. You&#8217;d naturally think, from the number of streams in these forests,
that they required a lot of moisture. Well, they don&#8217;t. Further South they grow
and flourish on perfectly dry ground. But their roots retain so much rain and
snow water that their tendency is to <i>make</i> streams. The dense crown helps
too, by preventing evaporation. You&#8217;ll find Sequoias flourishing in a mere rift
in a granite precipice. But wherever you find a dense growth, as you do here,
there you will find their roots giving out the seepage that feeds a million
streamlets, and these in turn feed the great rivers.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see these trees <i>must</i> be able to survive drouth or they could
not have survived the changes of so many thousand years. Why, these Sequoias
might have formed one continuous <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55'></a>55</span>forest from the American River on
South, if it had not been for the glaciers that swept down the great basins of
the San Joaquin and Kings&#8217; River, the Tuolumne and the Stanislaus.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But why didn&#8217;t the glaciers clean them off the basins of the Kaweah and
the Tule Rivers, too?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! There the giant rock spurs of the canyons of the King and the Kern
protected the Tule and the Kaweah, by shunting the ice off to right and
left.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s one thing more I&#8217;d like to know,&#8221; said Pedro. &#8220;Where will we
find the nut pines that have the pine nuts? Aren&#8217;t they delicious?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There are several kinds,&#8221; said Norris. &#8220;There is a queer little one
with cones growing like burrs on the trunk as well as on the limbs, but that is
only found on burnt ground. Another, that forms a dietary staple with the
Indians of Nevada, is to be found only on the East slope of the Sierra, and the
little nut pine that our California Indians harvest is away down in the
foot-hills among the white oaks and manzanitas, so I&#8217;m afraid whatever else we
come <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56'></a>56</span>across on this trip, we won&#8217;t want to count on pine
nuts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What interests <i>me</i> more,&#8221; said Ted, &#8220;is whether we are going to
come across any gold or not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now you&#8217;re talking!&#8221; the old prospector suddenly spoke up.</p>

<p>Ted&#8217;s eyes shone.</p>

<p>Ace had an experience about this time that flavored his nightmares for some
time to come. Following a lumber chute, one of these three board affairs, up the
side of a particularly steep slope one day, where at the time of the spring
floods the yellow pine logs had been sent down to the river, he thought to try a
little target shooting with Long Lester&#8217;s rifle. But at the first shot a bunch
of range cattle,&mdash;of whose presence he had not known,&mdash;began crowding curiously
near. He fired again, and a cow with a calf took alarm and started to charge
him, but was driven back with a few clods and a flourished stick.</p>

<p>He fired again. This time, quite by accident, his bullet hit an old bull
squarely on the horn. The shock at first stunned the animal, and he fell forward
on his knees. Recovering in an instant, however, the enraged animal made for
Ace.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<a id='illus-056'></a>
<img src='images/illus-056.jpg' alt='' />
<p class='c'>Leaping aboard a log he sent it shooting to the stream below.</p>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57'></a>57</span>The Senator&#8217;s son had that day worn his heavy leather chaps. He
had found them burdensome enough on his slow climb upward. They now impeded him
till he could not have outrun the animal had he tried, nor was there any tree
handy between him and it.</p>

<p>Then a wild thought struck him. The log slide!&mdash;It was mighty risky, but
then, so was the bull. Leaping aboard a log that still lay at the head of the
slide, he pulled the lever and sent it shooting to the stream below, and the
fallen pine needles flew out in a cloud before him, as the log hurled down the
grade. His heavy leather chaps really helped him balance now, and his hob-nails
helped him cling.</p>

<p>The log came to a stand-still before it reached the river,&mdash;but Ace did not.
And the bull was hopelessly out-distanced.</p>

<p class='cln0'>CHAPTER III</p>
<p class='cln1'>LIVING OFF THE WILDERNESS</p>
</div>

<p>On every side stretched a sea of peaks. They might have been in mid-ocean,
stranded on a desert island, had they not been on a mountain-top instead.</p>

<p>For one glorious fortnight they had camped beside white cascading rivers, and
along the singing streams that fed them, following their windings through flower
perfumed forests and on up into the granite country where glacier lakes lay
cupped between the peaks to unfathomable cobalt depths. They had seen deer by
the dozen feeding in the brush of the lower country,&mdash;graceful, big-eyed
creatures who allowed them to approach to within a stone&#8217;s throw before they
went bounding to cover. They had thrown crumbs to the grouse and quail that came
hesitatingly to inspect their camp site, protected at this season by the game
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59'></a>59</span>laws and so unaccustomed to human kind that they were all but tame.
They had crossed and recrossed rivers not too deep to ford, and rivers not too
swift to swim. They had scaled cliffs where nothing on hooves save a burro&mdash;or a
Rocky Mountain goat&mdash;could have followed after.</p>

<p>But always the shaggy gray donkeys had kept at their heels like dogs,&mdash;save
when they got temperamental or went on strike,&mdash;waggling their long ears in a
steady rhythm, exactly as if these appendages had been on ball bearings. The
burros, five in number, had each his individuality. There was Pepper, the old
prospector&#8217;s own comrade of many a mountain trail, who, knowing his superior
knowledge of the ways of slide rock and precipices, insisted always on being in
the lead. This preference on his part he enforced with a pair of the swiftest
heels the boys had ever seen. There was old Lazybones, as Pedro had named the
one who, presenting the greatest girth, had to carry the largest pack. There was
Trilby, of the dainty hooves, who never made a misstep. He&mdash;for the cognomen had
been somewhat misplaced&mdash;was entrusted with the things they valued most,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60'></a>60</span>their personal kit and the trout rods. The Bird was the one who did
the most singing,&mdash;though they all joined in on the chorus when they thought it
was time for the table scraps to be apportioned. And finally there was
Mephistopheles, whose disposition may have been soured under some previous
ownership,&mdash;since the blame must be placed somewhere. Ace had added him to Long
Lester&#8217;s four when a lumberman had offered him for fifteen dollars. The name
came afterwards. But though he sometimes held up operations on the trail, he was
big enough to carry 150 pounds of &#8220;grub,&#8221; and that meant a lot of good
eating.</p>

<p>Despite their hee-hawing, however, the diminutive pack animals did a deal of
talking with their ears. When startled, these prominent members were laid
forward to catch the sound. When displeased, the long ears were flattened along
the backs of their necks. If browse was good, they remained in the home
meadow,&mdash;after first circling it to make sure there was no foe in ambush. If
not, they wandered till they found good feed,&mdash;and one night they wandered so
many miles, hobbled as they were, that it <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61'></a>61</span>took all of the next
forenoon to find them and bring them back to camp.</p>

<p>They could walk a log with their packs to cross a stream, or, packs removed
and pullied across, they could swim it, if they were started up current and left
to guide themselves. They would not slip on smooth rock ledges, they could hop
up or down bowlders like so many bipeds. It was a constant marvel to Ace and
Pedro what they could do. No lead ropes were necessary at all.</p>

<p>Long Lester was meticulous in their care. Every afternoon when the packs were
removed he sponged their backs with cold water. And though the party was on its
way by seven every morning,&mdash;having risen with the first light of dawn,&mdash;and
though by ten they would have covered half of their average twelve miles a day,
the old guide never watered them till the sun was warm, which was generally not
till after the middle of the forenoon. For a wilderness trip comes to grief when
any one member, man or beast, gives out, as he knew from a lifetime of
experience in that rugged and unpeopled region.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62'></a>62</span>They had figured on about three pounds of food per day per
person, for the four weeks&#8217; trip. That loaded each burro with a grub list of
ninety pounds, and about ten pounds of personal equipment, besides the axes and
aluminums and such incidentals as soap and matches. Ease of packing was secured
by slipping into each of the food kyacks a case such as those in which a pair of
five gallon coal oil cans come.</p>

<p>Their kit included neats&#8217; foot oil, (scrupulously packed), for the wearing
qualities of their footwear along those stony trails depended in large degree on
keeping the leather soft. No mosquito netting was necessary in the
mountains,&mdash;it was too dry and cool for the insects,&mdash;but each member of the
party had a pair of buckskin gloves, six good pairs of all wool socks,&mdash;worn two
at a time to pad the feet against stone-bruise,&mdash;extra shoe laces, and a pair of
sneakers to rest his feet around camp. Norris carried a pocket telescope, and
Long Lester a hone made of the side of a cigar box with fine emery cloth pasted
on one side, coarse on the other. They saved on blankets by doubling each into
three crosswise,&mdash;except the old guide, who was too tall,&mdash;and on the higher,
colder <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63'></a>63</span>elevations they found that to wear a fresh wool union suit,
and socks warm from the fire, to sleep in, was as good as an extra blanket, if
not better.</p>

<p>Everything was to be turn and turn about,&mdash;Ace had been the most insistent
member of the party in not leaving Long Lester to do the lion&#8217;s share,&mdash;they
were obliged, each in turn, even Norris, to learn certain fundamental rules of
cookery. Long Lester got it down to this formula:</p>

<p>Put fresh vegetables into boiling salted water.</p>

<p>Put dried vegetables (peas and beans) into cold, unsalted water.</p>

<p>Soak dried fruit overnight.</p>

<p>To fry, have the pan just barely smoking.</p>

<p>To clean the frying pan, fill it with water and let it boil over, then hang
it up to dry. Jab greasy knives into the ground,&mdash;provided it is not stony.</p>

<p>You can fry more trout in a pan if you cut off their heads.</p>

<p>As the boiling point drops one degree for every 800 foot rise, twenty hours&#8217;
steady cooking will not boil beans in the higher altitudes <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64'></a>64</span>unless
you use soft water. They may be best cooked overnight in a hole lined with
coals, if put in when boiling, with the lid of the Dutch oven covered with
soil.</p>

<p>Three aluminum pails, nested, provided dish pan and kettles for hot and cold
water. Butter packed in pound tins kept fresh indefinitely in those cool
heights, and salt and sugar traveled well in waterproof tent silk bags. Long
Lester had figured on a minimum of a quarter of a pound each of sugar and bacon
per day per person, three pounds of pepper and twenty-five of salt.</p>

<p>Of course the one thing each member carried right on his person was a pepper
tin of matches, made waterproof with a strip of adhesive tape. For the snow
fields, they also had tinted spectacles, as a precaution against
snow-blindness.</p>

<p>Axmanship came to be the chief measure of their campcraft. Ace had wanted to
bring one of the double-bitts he saw the lumbermen using, but the old guide
vetoed it as more dangerous to the amateur than a butcher knife in the hands of
a baby.</p>

<p>The light weight single-bitt was the axe he had brought for the boys,
reserving a heavier <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65'></a>65</span>one for himself. These he had had ground thin,
but so that the blade would be thickest in the center and not stick fast in the
log. Both axe-heads wore riveted leather sheaths.</p>

<p>They took turn and turn about getting in the night wood. Fortunately the
boys, (Norris, too), had watched the lumbermen like lynxes, even Ted thinking to
get a few points from them. They noted, for one thing, that the professional
choppers struck rhythmically, landing each blow with precision on top of the
other, working slowly and apparently at ease,&mdash;certainly untiringly,&mdash;and making
no effort to sink the axe deeply.</p>

<p>They had also noticed that a lumberman will clear away all brush and vines
within axe reach before beginning, lest the instrument catch and deliver him a
cut.</p>

<p>They had learned, in logging up a down tree, not to notch it first on the
top, then discover too late that they could not turn the thing over to get at
the under side; but to stand on the log with feet as far apart as convenient,
and nick it on first one side, then the other, with great nicks as wide as the
log itself.</p>

<p>Pedro had to be shown how to chop kindling, <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66'></a>66</span>as his first attempt
resulted in a black and blue streak across his cheek where a flying chip struck
him. Long Lester had to show him how to lay his branches across a log. And the
old man insisted on his so doing, every time, for, he said, he knew a man who
had lost an eye by failing to observe this precaution. He also barely saved the
boys&#8217; axe from being driven into the ground by the well-meaning tenderfoot and
nicked on some buried stone. But when he found the Spanish boy starting to kerf
a prostrate log that lay on stony ground, he expressed himself so fluently that
Pedro never again, as long as he lived, forgot to place another log under the
butt, or else clear the stones from the ground around it.</p>

<p>The boys also learned to look for the hard yellow pine, when there was any to
be found, for their back-log, but for a quick fire to select fir balsam, spruce
or aspen. (Of course if they couldn&#8217;t get these, they used whatever they could
lay hands on.)</p>

<p>Pedro made the mistake, about this time, of tying a burro to a tree with two
half hitches, which, when the burro tugged, were all but impossible to undo.
After that he used the regular <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67'></a>67</span>hitching tie. As the burros were
always turned out at night, without even a hobble save for the leader, it became
necessary to be able to lasso them in the morning if they failed to come at
call. There was also the diamond hitch that had to be acquired if each was to do
his share with the pack-animals, all of which occupied fascinated hours around
the night-fire.</p>

<p>So much for the first two weeks. It was now time to circle around and start
back&mdash;some other way. Ace had done the packing the day they climbed above timber
line for an outlook. As Trilby had cut her foot, (or his foot, to be accurate),
the boy had added her pack to that of broad-backed Mephistopheles, in whose
kyacks he had&mdash;much against Long Lester&#8217;s teachings&mdash;entrusted the entire
remainder of their food. Pepper carried their personal equipment, and now that
half their supplies were eaten, the Bird and Lazybones carried firewood for them
from the wooded slopes below, that they might luxuriate beside a night fire. So
far, so good. But the peak of their night&#8217;s bivouac was flanked by higher peaks
that cut off their anticipated view, and before the little party could scale
these, they must descend the <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68'></a>68</span>gorge of another leaping, singing
stream that lay between.</p>

<p>As the pack train followed nimbly down the glacier-smoothed slope, and along
a ledge where the cliff rose sheer on one side, dropping as sheer on the other,
Mephistopheles gave a sudden shrill squeal, and before any one knew what it was
all about, went hurtling over the edge. The boys stared speechless as the
luckless animal hit the cascades below and went tumbling through the rapids and
over a waterfall, till the body was whirled to the bank and caught in a crevice
of the rock.</p>

<p>Here they were, ten days&#8217; hike from the nearest base of supplies, and the
entire remainder of their food,&mdash;they did not mourn the burro&mdash;three thousand
feet below, or more likely washed a mile down stream by this time, what had not
sunk to the bottom.</p>

<p>They might have been in mid-ocean, as Ted had remarked,&mdash;stranded on a desert
island,&mdash;but for their trout rods, and one rifle. The game laws could be
disregarded in their extremity. But they were days from the last deer they had
sighted, and their main dependence must be on the fishing.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69'></a>69</span>Ahead, the trail wound down into a grove of rich tan trunks
against the green of juniper. Gray granite worn into fantastic shapes,&mdash;castles
and giant tables,&mdash;dwarfed and twisted trees rooted in rock crevices, white
waters roaring against the canyon wall like a storm-wind in the tree-tops,
fallen trunks, patches of flaming fire-weed. This was the wilderness against
which they must pit their wild-craft if they would eat.</p>

<p>By the time the sun slanted at five o&#8217;clock, Norris called a halt by the side
of a moist green meadow where the burros would find browse, and all hands
turning to and unpacking the kyacks, they hobbled the animals with a neat loop
about their fore-legs. Then they cut, each of them, a good armful of browse for
his bed. Long Lester strode off with his rifle in search of anything he might
find for the pot, while Norris and the boys scrambled down to the river with
their trout rods.</p>

<p>He broke trail along a narrow ledge, just such a one as the luckless burro
had gone hurtling over when his pack scraped the rising wall. Almost a sheer
drop, and the rapids roared in torrents of white foam. Pedro clung
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70'></a>70</span>to every root and every rock crack for fear of growing dizzy.</p>

<p>&#8220;My fault entirely,&#8221; Ace reproached himself, as he thought of the lost
flour and bacon, rice, onions, cheese, smoked ham, dried fruit, coffee, canned
beets and spinach, tinned jams, and other compact and rib-stretching items of
their so lovingly planned duffle. &#8220;Never should have packed it all on one
burro.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Senator&#8217;s son had a dry fly outfit that was his treasure. Ted used the
crudest kind of hook and line for bait casting. The subject was one of keen
rivalry between them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dad always prayed: &#8216;May the East wind never blow,&#8217; when we went
fishing down in Maine,&#8221; dogmatized Ace.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Pop was born in Illinois, and he used to say, &#8216;When the wind is in
the South, it blows your bait into a fish&#8217;s mouth.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh! That may be poetry, but we don&#8217;t have much of any wind out here
except the west wind. And if we wait for a cloudy day in this neck o&#8217; the world,
we&#8217;ll wait till September.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All the same,&#8221; insisted Ted, &#8220;trout do bite best when it rains,
because, don&#8217;t you see, the <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71'></a>71</span>big fellows lie on the bottom, just
gobbling up the worms the rain washes down to them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They won&#8217;t rise to a fly in the rain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I dunno anything about dry flies, though I sh&#8217;d think they couldn&#8217;t
<i>see</i> the fly up on the surface, with the water all r&#8217;iled the way it gets
in a storm.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No more can they when the sun glares.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then, you better choose the shady spots. I don&#8217;t see sign n&#8217;r
symptom of even a wind cloud to-day.&#8221;&mdash;And yet, even as he gazed
argumentatively at the horizon, a pink-white bank of cumulus began drifting into
view in the niche between two distant peaks.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gosh! It&#8217;s sunset already,&#8221; exclaimed Ted.</p>

<p>&#8220;At half-past five!&#8221;&mdash;Ace peered at his wrist watch, then held it to his
ear. &#8220;Besides, it&#8217;s in the East<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Looks more like a fire starting off there,&#8221; contributed Norris.
&#8220;Whew! See old Red Top, there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Red Top!&mdash;Where Rosa is?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think it must be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Radcliffe&#8217;s plumb worried, with the woods <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72'></a>72</span>so dry, I&#8217;ll
bet,&#8221; Ted surmised. &#8220;And short a coupla fire outlooks, at that, I heard
there in the Canyon.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this point they reached the mouth of the creek that had wriggled down from
some spring, and Ace elected to follow it upstream with his Brown Hackles, which
he dropped on the water with the most delicate care lest their advent appear an
unnatural performance to the wary troutlets watching from the shady pools.</p>

<p>The slender stream raced dazzlingly in the reddening sunshine, as Ace tickled
the placid surface of each pool, and the up-stream side of each fallen log,
careful lest his shadow fall betrayingly across his miniature hunting grounds.
He kept a good ten feet from the bank. And before the red glow had started
climbing the Western slope, he had a full string of little fellows,&mdash;the
prettiest rainbow trout he had ever seen.</p>

<p>Ted, sighting another creek, climbed back along the canyon wall to follow it
down-stream with his bait can and his short, stiff willow rod, cut for the
occasion with his good old jack-knife. His bait was the remnant of the ham
sandwich he had saved that noon for the purpose,&mdash;though <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73'></a>73</span>he had
little dreamed at the time how much would depend on their next fishing
jaunt.</p>

<p>Keen to out-do his chum by back-country methods, he pushed through the brush
that made the gully a streak of green against the granite, until he came to a
bend. Here, he knew, there would likely be a pool. He approached warily from
above, lengthening his line. He cast well above the bend, so that his bait would
sink to the bottom. He was rewarded at once with a bite. With a quick flip, he
drew the fish away, and began his string.</p>

<p>For some time he followed down-stream before he saw another likely-looking
place. An up-turned stump awoke his sporting blood. Safe refuge for a trout in
more ways than one, it offered a 50-50 chance of losing his hook. But Ted lifted
skyward at the instant of the bite, and all was well.</p>

<p>An eddy of foam, the shade of an over-hanging bowlder, then another upturned
stump, (on these wind-swept mountain sides there were many such), and Ted&#8217;s
spirits rose by degrees.</p>

<p>Meantime Pedro passed the rapids, climbed to a point well above, and selected
a smooth green stretch of river for his operations. It <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74'></a>74</span>had meant
stiff going, and would mean more before he made his way back up the canyon wall,
but something about their present crisis had challenged his reserves.</p>

<p>Pedro always used a spoon when he wasn&#8217;t fishing for pure sport. On this
sunny stretch, so clear in the red glow of approaching sunset that the bottom
was plainly visible, he could see the fat old patriarchs lazing the late
afternoon away. But he was soon rousing them to find out what that little
shining thing could be that darted so rapidly through their habitat,&mdash;that tiny
bit of metallic white so unlike anything their jaded appetites had yet
negotiated.</p>

<p>The bright silver blade, only a quarter inch in width, perhaps three times as
long, spun against the current, cavorting along jerk by jerk, (with time between
jerks for the scaly ones to think it over), soon began to get results. As the
trout were all on the bottom resting till twilight should set in, Pedro craftily
allowed the spinner to sink till it all but raked the bottom before beginning
that tantalizing play.</p>

<p>Norris, too, tried a spinner, though he chose rapid water. There was one
great beauty, green above and orange beneath, that baited his <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75'></a>75</span>fancy.
For some time he dangled the lure before he felt the heavy fish. Then a long
rush, that sent his line whistling out like lightning, a moment&#8217;s quiet,
followed by another rush, and he had landed a great beauty of a five-pounder
with the hook hard fast in his jaws.</p>

<p>After that Norris returned to camp, where Ace and Ted were already jubilantly
comparing notes. Long Lester came in with a bag of birds and rabbits.</p>

<p>Of course their catch had to be broiled. Pedro arrived in time to join them
in &#8220;which will you have, or trout,&#8221;&mdash;for the game had been saved for
breakfast. The boys ate with relish, though without salt, and later listened to
Long Lester telling tales with his boots to the bon-fire, bronze faced,
nonchalant. At 8,000 feet, the air grew noticeably cooler with the turning of
the wind down-canyon, and the boys heaped down-wood liberally in a pyramid. The
dry evergreens snapped in a shower of sparks as the full moon, silvering the
snow-clad peaks, deepened the shadows under the trees.</p>

<p>On the fragrance of crushed fir boughs they finally slept, all thought of the
morrow drowned in dreams.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76'></a>76</span>Out of the painted sunsets and yellow sands of the Salton Sea,
land of centipedes and cactus, blistering sun, and parching thirst, and all
things cruel and ugly, had come Sanchez, a Mexican, with his son and an old man
who had been his servant, to lay ties for the narrow gauge railway that was to
zig-zag up the canyon walls for a lumber company. King&#8217;s Lumber Company had
fired them for reasons that will appear. Suffice it now that all their
blistering bitterness and parching hate had focused on these forests.</p>

<p>Rosa, alone on the Red Top fire outlook scaffold, had seen a pin-point of
light the night before that she took for a camp-fire, but whose, she could not
know.</p>

<p>Breakfast, such as it was, disposed of, the four deceptively meek looking
burros were lined up in the lupin perfumed meadow, in semblance of a pack-train,
(the hundred pounds of duffle divided between them that they might make faster
time, as well as a safe-guard against further accidents). A committee of the
whole now decided they must catch more fish and dry them, then lead a forced
march to Guadaloupe Rancho, and if they found range cattle, they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77'></a>77</span>would bring down a calf and square it later with the owner.</p>

<p>For two days Norris, Ace and Ted caught fish, while Pedro dried them, and
Long Lester scoured the woods for game birds, rabbits,&mdash;anything and everything
he might find. Then came two strenuous days during which they bore in the
general direction of Red Top.</p>

<p>Without warning, they came to a sheer ledge fringed with minarets, and stared
across a glacier-gouged canyon a mile wide. Progress in that direction was
effectually checked. They found themselves with a view of such miles of
snow-capped peaks that they stood speechless, with little thrills running up and
down their spines at the sheer beauty of the scene.</p>

<p>To the right, the way was clear across a rock-strewn elevation where the only
trees were squat, twisted, with branches reaching along the ground as if for
additional foot-hold against the never-ceasing trade winds. Again they were
brought to a halt by a peak of granite blocks.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know, fellows,&#8221; said Norris, suddenly, &#8220;mountain-building is
still going on, under our very feet.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78'></a>78</span>&#8220;Is there going to be an earthquake?&#8221; gasped Pedro.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are likely to be slight earthquake shocks any time in this region.
The last big &#8217;quake, that caused any marked dislocation, was in 1872, though, so
we have nothing to worry about. But I&#8217;m going to be able to show you some rock
formations that will illustrate what I was telling you the other day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean,&#8221; brightened Ace, &#8220;showing how these 14,000 foot peaks
attained their present height?&mdash;How there were two up-lifts?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and we are standing, this very minute, on a basalt step that some
earthquake has faulted from the main basalt-capped mass. Just see how the whole
story is revealed right there in this gorge! You can see the streaks of basalt,
which we know lie in horizontal layers, and rest on vertical strata of the
Carboniferous and Triassic age.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whoa&mdash;there!&#8221; groaned Long Lester. &#8220;Would you mind telling us that
again, in words of one syllable? I calc&#8217;late it must be a mighty interesting
yarn, from the hints you&#8217;ve let out now and ag&#8217;in, but how&#8217;n tarnation<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79'></a>79</span>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; grinned Ted, &#8220;do tell it, Mr. Norris, so&#8217;s Les and
I can get it too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Bout all I&#8217;ve got any strangle hold on,&#8221; complained the old man, &#8220;so
fur, is thet these yere valleys was gouged out by the glaciers, a good long
spell ago. Now there&#8217;s one thing I&#8217;m a-goin&#8217; to ask you, Mister, before we go
any further. What did you mean by that there&mdash;coal age?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; vouched Norris, &#8220;was when most of the coal was formed, away
back before man appeared on earth,&mdash;before there were any of the plants and
animals as we know them to-day.</p>

<p>&#8220;Picture a time when the water was covered with green scum, and the air was
steamy, when the swampy forests were composed of giant ferns and club mosses and
inhabited by giant newts and salamanders, dragon-flies and snakes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How&mdash;how do you know all thet?&#8221; gasped Long Lester.</p>

<p>&#8220;Partly by the fossils. It&#8217;s a big study,&mdash;geology, we call it,&mdash;and the
scientists who reason these things out use what has been discovered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80'></a>80</span>by astronomy and chemistry and a lot of other sciences. It&#8217;s a long
story.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But a <i>thriller</i>,&#8221; Ace assured them, as Norris lighted his pipe on
the lee of a bowlder. &#8220;Can&#8217;t we rest here a few minutes, Mr. Norris? Those
burros were about winded. Can&#8217;t get &#8217;em to budge yet. Come on, fellows, snuggle
up,&#8221; as Norris seated himself compliantly, back against the bowlder. They all
crept close, for the wind was blowing hard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where did this earth come from in the first place?&#8221; asked Ted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, of course you know that our sun is only one of millions of stars,
and very far from being the largest, at that. Some larger star, in passing the
sun, by the pull of its own greater gravity, separated some large fragments from
that fiery, gaseous mass, and started our planetary system. We don&#8217;t want to go
too far into astronomy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But astronomy shows you how they know all this,&#8221; Ace assured the old
man, who appeared divided between wide-eyed amazement and incredulity, (as,
indeed, were Ted and Pedro).</p>

<p>&#8220;Our earth, like the other planets, was one <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81'></a>81</span>of the knots of
denser matter on the two-armed luminous spiral which began circling the sun.
There were smaller particles which were attracted to the earth by earth gravity
and which increased the size of the earth till it was far larger than it is now.
Ever since, the earth has been shrinking periodically, and when it shrinks, its
surface becomes wrinkled, and these wrinkles we call mountain ranges.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; interpolated Ace, shining eyed, &#8220;the crust of the earth
got cooled, while the inside was still a mass of molten metal and gas, which
kept boiling over on to the crust,&mdash;couldn&#8217;t you say, Mr. Norris?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got the idea.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I s&#8217;pose that&#8217;s <i>the hot place!</i>&#8221; chuckled the old man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Probably where they got the idea. In time the metals and heavier
substances sank, while the lighter ones rose as granite rocks, till there was an
outer shell miles thick.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes, in Alaska, is a volcanic region where
the ground is hot and breaks through with one even now,&mdash;I was there several
years ago,&mdash;but generally speaking, this earth has a crust 150 miles thick.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82'></a>82</span>&#8220;As I was saying, the continents are built of the lighter
granite, chiefly, while the oceans lie on the heavier basalt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I thought you said we were on a chunk of basalt now,&#8221; said Ted.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are. You know the Pacific has flowed where now you see these peaks, as
the high lands have been worn down between successive upbuildings.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But&mdash;where did the water in the ocean come from in the first place?&#8221;
marveled the old prospector.</p>

<p>&#8220;Out of the earth,&#8221; smiled Norris. &#8220;Up through hot springs, geysers
and volcanoes. The water vapor was always here, you know,&mdash;mixed with the molten
rock and gases.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I swan!&#8221; ejaculated the old guide. &#8220;I thought I knew something about
rocks, but&mdash;this beats anything in my kid&#8217;s fairy books.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You bet!&#8221; Ace agreed. &#8220;You just wait till you hear<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I expect we&#8217;d better start on now,&#8221; Norris rose. &#8220;Do you chaps
realize what a predicament we are in?&#8221; and shading his eyes with a lowered
hat brim, he peered off across the hummocky <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83'></a>83</span>granite slopes, which
shone mirror-like in places under the noon-day sun.</p>

<p>A moving speck in the sky to the North drew an exclamation from him. In
another moment a sound that increased to a hum like that of a giant motor-boat
descended from the skies, and the speck disclosed itself as a mammoth
aeroplane.</p>

<p>&#8220;Signal them!&#8221; cried Norris. &#8220;What can we signal them with? Get out
your pocket mirrors, quick!&#8221;</p>

<div class='chapter'>

<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84'></a>84</span>
<p class='cln0'>CHAPTER IV</p>
<p class='cln1'>WITH THE AIR PATROL</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Signal them!&#8221; chorused the three boys, acting on Norris&#8217;s suggestion,
(flashing their distress with their pocket mirrors), while Long Lester stood
measuring the flight of the aeroplane.</p>

<p>His practiced eye also detected a faint bluish haze that rose behind the
ridge at the North,&mdash;a haze altogether unlike that which foretells a storm. In
fact, the sun glinting from the wings of the giant wings and from the
glacial-polished slopes beneath forbade that explanation.</p>

<p>Like most backwoodsmen, the old prospector said the least when he felt the
most. His lean body suddenly grew tense. &#8220;It&#8217;s a fire,&#8221; he told himself.
&#8220;An everlastingly big one, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a DeHaviland,&#8221; decided Ace, as the huge bombing-plane came
nearer. &#8220;Must be the Fire Patrol!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85'></a>85</span>A moment more and the buzzing apparatus began sinking into a
&#8220;pancake&#8221; landing,&mdash;fortunately, just above the wide sweep of the granite
butte. Could it be engine trouble, Norris wondered, or had it seen their
signals? Lucky they were on an elevation.</p>

<p>With the sound like a saw-mill in full blast, the great ship jolted to terra
firma, within shouting distance,&mdash;and hardly had she come to a full stop than
the boys had raced to her side.</p>

<p>&#8220;I say!&#8221; exclaimed a familiar voice, as the observer climbed out. It
was Ranger Radcliffe! &#8220;Where did <i>you</i> folks drop from?&#8221;</p>

<p>Norris explained the marooned camping expedition.</p>

<p>Radcliffe&#8217;s face was lined with fatigue and anxiety. &#8220;Big fire off
there!&#8221; he motioned. &#8220;Been directing a hundred men. Broke out in three
places, all within twenty-four hours, and not even an electric storm to account
for it. Want to help?&#8221; And as the little party voiced unanimous consent, he
proceeded to draft them in, at the Government nine dollars per day.</p>

<p>He could have compelled their services, as he had that of a party of campers
down towards <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86'></a>86</span>Kings&#8217; River. In a few words, his voice vibrating to
his high nervous tension, the young forest officer had them all thrilling with
patriotic fervor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now get your things,&#8221; he directed. &#8220;May have to fight it for a week!
You can turn your burros out to forage for themselves, and I guess you&#8217;ll find
them again when this is over. If you don&#8217;t the Government will probably square
it with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The chums swiftly retraced their steps to where the animals waited patiently,
removing the packs and sending the little donkeys down the trail to better
pasturage. They might wander, but they would be safe. With their swift heels
they could defend themselves from even a mountain lion. And they were apt to
keep to the mountain meadows, where was food and water.</p>

<p>Their run at such an altitude had given Pedro a touch of mountain sickness,
and he had to lie flat till his heart beat more normally and his nose stopped
bleeding.</p>

<p>The big &#8217;plane carried a relay of provisions for the fire fighters already
established, whom it had brought for the purpose from the Zuni <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87'></a>87</span>Mine.
As corned beef and hardtack were distributed, the hungry campers thought they
had never tasted anything so good in their lives. Not even the Thanksgiving
turkeys of later years were ever spiced with such appetites.</p>

<p>This fire,&mdash;or rather, these three fires, so mysteriously concomitant, the
Ranger explained when the boys returned, had broken so far from any ranch or
work camp that they were hard pressed for men to fight it.</p>

<p>&#8220;You fellows will have a mighty important part to play for the next few
days,&#8221; he assured them, &#8220;or I miss my guess.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurray!&#8221; shouted Ace. &#8220;Three cheers for the U. S. Airplane
Patrol!&#8221; For he knew something of the work started at the close of the war.
Following regular daily routes, this patrol not only detects fires and follows
up campers or others who may have started them, (carelessly or otherwise), but
in times of emergency carries the fire leader from one strategic point to
another,&mdash;where as likely as not there are neither roads for him to go in his
machine, nor even horse-back trails,&mdash;till he has shown the volunteer firemen
how to trench and back-fire.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88'></a>88</span>They needed some one, the Ranger said, to hold the top of the
next ridge,&mdash;between which and the boys lay that inaccessible canyon it would
have taken them days to have scaled afoot. By day they were merely to watch for
flying brands. Their chief work would come at night, when the wind would turn
and blow down canyon, and they might successfully back-fire.</p>

<p>The fire had started in two places on the opposite bank of the Kawa, and in
one place this side of the river, and was eating its way along the slopes with
the wind which swept them by day. It certainly looked like the work of
incendiaries.</p>

<p>Ace begged permission to wireless for his little Spanish &#8217;plane, in its
hangar in Burlingame, that it might be employed in some volunteer capacity, and
Radcliffe accepted his offer.</p>

<p>The huge DeHaviland required all of the flat surface afforded by the butte,
for its preliminary run. They were off with a roar. As they glided across to the
flat-topped ridge on the other side of the canyon, they could see the ravenous
flames climbing tall pines and firs, racing from limb to limb, through the forest
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89'></a>89</span>roof, devouring the steeps, doubtless richly coated with underbrush
and downwood. The roar and crackle of it filled their ears sickeningly, as they
thought of the naked mountainsides that would be left,&mdash;mere skeletons of
barkless tree trunks, where they had camped on brown pine needles,&mdash;smooth,
silent, inches deep, soft under their tired feet, dry as tinder and aromatic
with Nature&#8217;s finest perfume.</p>

<p>How the devourer would relish the pitch and resin oozing from the juicy bark!
How secure it must feel, on those slopes never climbed by man, with the autumn
rains months away, and the fire fighters like so many ants trying with axe and
shovel to mark off on the hot forest floor a boundary beyond which the fiery
tongues must not lick.</p>

<p>Had the wind not been in the other direction, they would have been
overwhelmed with the smoke that billowed darkly till it could have been seen 50
miles away, the red sun scarcely lightening the gloom. Even where they landed,
an occasional hot breath scorched their faces and set their eyes to smarting,
while their winged ship nosed frantically up and away again before she should
meet Icarus&#8217; fate.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90'></a>90</span>&#8220;Some day,&#8221; Radcliffe had told them that day at the rodeo,
&#8220;the Forest Service Air Patrol, which serves now to give warning of the
tiniest smoke, and so saves men and millions where every minute counts, will
fight with glass bombs of fire extinguisher, whose trajectory falling from a
&#8217;plane in rapid flight will have to be calculated to a nicety, but which,
delivered while the fire is in its infancy, will do the work of many
men.&#8221;</p>

<p>The worst difficulty would be at night, when though the fire shows plainer,
the pilot would have to depend largely on his own sense of equilibrium to tell
him at what angle his ship was inclined. True, acetylene gas lamps properly
protected from the wind could be made to light up the ground below when
alighting, but at an altitude of even a mile, little can be seen of the
landscape to guide one on one&#8217;s course. The 2,000-foot firs of the Sierra slopes
appear but as green-black billows.</p>

<p>As the great ship raced toward the flaming forest, their talk at the barbecue
raced through the mind of the Senator&#8217;s son. &#8220;Some day,&#8221; Radcliffe had
challenged them, &#8220;you want to see Glacier National Park, with its ice-capped
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91'></a>91</span>peaks and its precipices thousands of feet deep, its glacier-fed
lakes and Alpine scenery. And of course you must all see the geysers of the
Yellowstone, its petrified forests and mud volcanoes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And bears?&#8221; Ted had laughed with a glance at Pedro.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, all sorts of wild animals. And some time you want to explore the
cliff dwellings in Mesa Verde and the 14,000 foot peaks in Rocky Mountain
National Park. By that time you will be ready to go to Southern Alaska and try
Mt. McKinley, which is worth while not so much because it is the highest
mountain in North America, (Mt. Whitney is nearly as high), but because it
stands the highest above the surrounding country of any mountain in the world.
Mt. Whitney is just an easy climb above a sea of surrounding peaks; you don&#8217;t
realize the height at all.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you know we have a National Park in Hawaii?&mdash;But Roosevelt,&mdash;or
Greater Sequoia Park,&mdash;is going to remain an unspoiled wilderness for a good
many years to come, with three great canyons larger than that of Yosemite
itself.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92'></a>92</span>&#8220;Kings&#8217; River and the Kern,&#8221; Ace had agreed, &#8220;but what is
the third?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tehipite.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, of course.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We wanted to go over the John Muir Trail right along the crest of the
Sierras to Yosemite.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve hundreds of miles of almost unexplored country! Enough vacation
places to last a lifetime! Rivers alive with trout! Bears! Cougars!&#8221; the
Ranger had commented.</p>

<p>&#8220;And rattlers,&#8221; Long Lester had added grimly.</p>

<p>&#8220;And rattlers. And they&#8217;re the only living thing we need fear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not excluding range cattle?&#8221; Pedro had wanted to be assured.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not when you&#8217;re all together. Of course if you were alone you might break
a leg or something that would leave you helpless, and you&#8217;d sure be a long way
from anything to eat unless you had it with you.</p>

<p>&#8220;But unless we look alive the Big Interests are going to wrest away these
beauty spots that we have set aside for our National playgrounds,&#8221; Radcliffe
had declared.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93'></a>93</span>&#8220;That&#8217;s just what Dad says!&#8221; Ace had remembered.</p>

<p>&#8220;And why? Not because they need the irrigation and water power of the big
falls, for they can have it after the streams leave the parks, but because it
would cost them a good deal less to secure these things of Uncle Sam than it
would to build their projects outside Park limits. There isn&#8217;t a beauty spot in
the West that some commercial interest hasn&#8217;t designs on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s one thing I mean to fight!&#8221; Ace squared his chin as the
DeHaviland whisked them to their particular ridge, a table mountain, or butte,
where half a dozen recruits had already been landed with tools and grub.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure seems as if these fires had been set,&#8221; mused Long Lester, as
Radcliffe bade them good-by,&mdash;for he had to be in a dozen places at once, that
day.</p>

<p>&#8220;But who did it?&#8221; demanded Ace fiercely.</p>

<p>&#8220;No savvy dat kind feller,&#8221; said a Canadian half breed, who was just
starting off with a pick. &#8220;&#8217;E&#8217;s bad feller, dat!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure is!&#8221; agreed Ace. &#8220;I don&#8217;t savvy him either,&mdash;any one who would
deliberately burn&mdash;<i>that!</i>&#8221; <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94'></a>94</span>with a wave of his arm toward
the forested gorge, up which already rose a noticeable heat. The red tongues,
racing through the spruce and cedar tops, shone through the smoke gloom, whence
issued a distant roaring which was the wind created by the super-heated stretch
of territory.</p>

<p>To the left, a gleaming-eyed cougar crept through the shadows, himself a
shadow. To the right, a huge, furry looking shadow ran clumsily, flat-footedly.
A tiny shadow hopped from almost under their feet, and above their heads flapped
a small covey of lighter shadows. Writhing above the dark tops of the doomed
trees rose the yellow-gray smoke that was their departing shades.</p>

<p>The faces of the fire-fighters were grimly blackened with smoke and grime,
their shirts clung wet with perspiration to their swelling muscles, and their
dry throats clacked when they tried to swallow.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d sure like to find the fellow that started <i>that!</i>&#8221; muttered
Ace.</p>

<p class='cln0'>CHAPTER V</p>
<p class='cln1'>A DARING FEAT</p>
</div>

<p>As sun-set turned the wind down canyon, all hands made a sally down the
mountain side in the hope of establishing a line of back-fire, but the ground
soon became too hot for them, while the air was filled chokingly with ash and
char-dust. They had to retreat to the ridge. It was a night never to be
forgotten.</p>

<p>When the wind turned at dawn,&mdash;with their line still intact,&mdash;the exhausted
party took turn and turn about, snatching a few hours&#8217; sleep, wrapped in their
blankets on the rocks, or making coffee.</p>

<p>Ace had forgotten all about his wireless message when, shortly after noon,
his own ship arrived. It had had a search for him, and had landed, apparently,
on the very ledge of basalt where the DeHaviland had picked them up.</p>

<p>The beauty of the Spanish ship was that it <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96'></a>96</span>was built to land on a
space no bigger than a house roof. It carried two propellers at the top. The
pilot had only to start these and it sucked itself straight up into the air.
Then he twirled the propeller on the front and sailed away, as easily as you
please.</p>

<p>He landed by reversing these operations. He could alight on a shed roof if he
had to, (provided, of course, that the roof was flat). The only danger would be
if the propellers should go on strike.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been getting a wireless message,&#8221; said the pilot. &#8220;There! Better
take it, Mr. King,&#8221; to Ace.</p>

<p>Ace&#8217;s eyes grew dark as he interpreted the frantic ticking that his apparatus
gave him. &#8220;Why&mdash;<i>Rosa&#8217;s</i> sending this!&mdash;She&#8217;s marooned&mdash;there at the Red
Top fire-outlook!&mdash;&#8216;Fire on three sides, on fourth, rapids of Kawa River
Gorge. Send help&mdash;if you can,&#8217;&#8221; he translated, while the boys waited,
breathless. &#8220;Three men where first-fire started&mdash;silver buttons&mdash;shining in
the sun.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That sounds like Mexicans!&#8221; said Pedro.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now what?&#8221; asked Norris. &#8220;Where&#8217;s the Ranger, do you suppose?&#8221; But
just then he <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97'></a>97</span>saw a flaming branch blown across their line. Like
tinder the dried firs burst into a shower of sparks, and with a call to the men,
he darted after it. Ace remained behind to wireless, and Ted to quench their
cook-fire, while Ace&#8217;s pilot flung off his coat and ran after the fire
fighters.</p>

<p>Ace King did one thing supremely well. He knew his ship. He was born to
fly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hey, Ted,&#8221; he brought a certain line of reasoning to a head, &#8220;the
Ranger can&#8217;t <i>land</i> with that DeHaviland, if he does go after Rosa. You
know the lay-out on Red Top.&#8221; (The boys had passed that way.)</p>

<p>&#8220;Yeh,&mdash;Cæsar!&mdash;That&#8217;s right. No place there half large enough for the
bombing-plane!&mdash;That poor kid!&#8221; He shuddered. &#8220;What&#8217;s the answer?&#8221; for
he saw that Ace had some plan. &#8220;I&#8217;m with you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just this. We can&#8217;t leave her there to be burned alive. Radcliffe can&#8217;t
do any more than we can about it. Besides, he&#8217;s got his hands full, wherever he
is. But a forest guard was <i>killed</i> last year directing fire fighters from
a plane. Went into a tail spin and fell into the flames.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know. It&#8217;s mighty dangerous flying over <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98'></a>98</span>a fire. Isn&#8217;t there
anything Rosa can do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just what<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221; Ace hesitated, deep in thought.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard of people taking refuge in caves, but where would she find the
cave?&mdash;&#8217;N&#8217; I&#8217;ve heard of &#8217;em going to a rock-slide and piling up a barricade of
stone and lying behind it while the fire swept that way. It cuts off some of the
heat and flying sparks<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here!&#8221; Ace vociferated with the suddenness of a machine gun.
&#8220;I&#8217;m going for her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir! I can land there, anyway. Then if it queers the machine, I&#8217;ll
take Rosa down to the rapids. I know a fellow that was in a big fire in Montana.
When it cut them off, each man soaked his blanket and got under it in midstream
while the fire jumped to the other bank. They made a sort of tepee around their
heads, got clear under water, and just came up for an occasional breath. Gee!
He says it roared like a thousand trains as it swept over them. So that&#8217;s what
we&#8217;ll do&mdash;that is, unless we can get back in the ship.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99'></a>99</span>Unconsciously he patted his machine, and Ted knew what it would
mean to him to lose it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps&mdash;perhaps you <i>can</i> bring it back,&#8221; he ventured.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure thing!&#8221; Ace gave his spirits a toss. &#8220;Anyway, here
goes!&mdash;Good-by.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the idea?&#8221; yelled Ted aggrievedly. &#8220;Going to leave your
side-kick behind?&#8221; and he climbed into the observer&#8217;s place.</p>

<p>&#8220;Coming!&#8221; Ace wirelessed the girl. &#8220;Be on meadow&mdash;we&#8217;ll pick you
up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If our propellers don&#8217;t go on strike,&#8221; he added to himself. Still he
knew he could slow to 80 miles an hour and pancake down. He would first circle
well away from the fire, with its super-heated air column, till they came to the
gorge of the Kawa. There would be a narrow zone, he figured, of less destructive
atmosphere, the air channel over the 2,000 foot canyon.</p>

<p>With a peek at castor oil and gasoline, they started, looping and curving
straight to 15,000 feet, then Westward, away from the fire zone. Though the day
was fair, the spiral of hot air rising above the flaming forest kept them
pitching <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100'></a>100</span>and lurching in a short chop that made Ted look green, and
gave even Ace a cold feeling at the pit of his stomach.</p>

<p>The sea of snow-clad peaks slid by beneath them, the sun flashing from the
granite slopes. Rising and falling, rising and falling in the rough, upper air,
they felt as if they were in a swift elevator. A cloud to the West looked like a
fleecy carpet beneath them. The West wind kept swinging the machine till Ace had
continually to bring it back in line with the rapids of the Kawa which was his
objective point.</p>

<p>It took but instants, though it seemed ages to both boys. Now it was time to
race quivering down the gorge of canyon-cooled air. Would they make it against
the devastating breath of the flames!&mdash;Now they were looking straight down into
that picture of red and&mdash;black. Rosa, watching frantically from the wee patch of
green which was her mountain meadow, looked like a dot with waving arms. The air
became a stretch of dizzy rapids. The combined roar of the flames and the river
beneath nearly drowned the nearer sound of the descending &#8217;plane.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<a id='illus-100'></a>
<img src='images/illus-100.jpg' alt='' />
<p class='c'>Raced quivering down the gorge of canyon-cooled air.</p>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101'></a>101</span>With heart that fluttered near to bursting, Ace accomplished the
quick swoop, Ted snatched the girl aboard, and they were up again.</p>

<p>The miracle had been accomplished!&mdash;The mountains lay like a relief map
beneath them, greenest down the canyons that branches Westward from the gleaming
crest of the main divide, the snow-capped peaks gleaming silver in the sunlight.
The fire zone lay like a small inferno behind them.</p>

<p>Back at fire-fighting headquarters, Ace&#8217;s nerves took toll of him in
trembling knees. He had been all steel. Now he literally dropped in his tracks,
and in ten minutes was fast asleep.</p>

<p>Rosa, now that the danger was all over, broke down and wept hysterically, to
Ted&#8217;s infinite embarrassment.</p>

<p>Norris was just returning with the triumphant fire-fighters. They had
actually not missed them. When, four hours later, Ace awoke and responded to
Pedro&#8217;s &#8220;Come and get it!&#8221; as he ladled out the ham and beans, he found
himself a hero, and Ted his press agent.</p>

<p>&#8220;This country would do well to emulate France,&#8221; Norris was explaining.
&#8220;France offers a government subsidy to encourage commercial
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102'></a>102</span>aviation. Our Congress has thus far refused to realize the need of
appropriations. For it is by trade that aviation will develop.</p>

<p>&#8220;We need above all things more airplane fire patrols. We have the men,
trained aviators left from the war,&mdash;we have the equipment, and the men could
protect not only our National Forests, but at the same time keep a watchful eye
on the millions of acres of state lands and timber privately owned, which lie
adjacent to Government holdings.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you fellows realize that in five years, areas have been burned that
would more than fill the state of Utah! At that rate how long will our forests
last? And think what a paper famine alone would mean!&#8221; He paused for lack of
breath to express the intensity of his feeling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hundreds of men have given up their lives in the service,&mdash;fighting
fire.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Ace, &#8220;but Dad says there&#8217;s a bigger fight to put up in
Congress for forestry appropriations.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your father is doing good work,&#8221; stated Norris.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s trying to, you bet!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103'></a>103</span>&#8220;These fire-fighting &#8217;planes can sail over the highest peaks
in the United States. They can travel 14 hours without a landing. They can
communicate with those below by radio. And they don&#8217;t have to have smooth
landing places, merely ground that is free from stumps. We have over twenty
million acres of National Forests alone, (not counting those in Alaska), and
they are worth $220,000,000.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee! And there&#8217;s just as much risk as in dodging enemy &#8217;planes,&#8221; Ted
enthused, &#8220;flying over fires, and finding landing places when your motor goes
on strike.&#8221; His eyes glowed across at Ace.</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh, you&#8217;re safe enough above a thousand feet,&#8221; minimized Ace,
modestly. &#8220;These accidents practically all happen below a thousand
feet.&#8221;</p>

<p>But by now supper was eaten, and it was time to get back to work. Norris,
acting on Radcliffe&#8217;s suggestion, had been stationing the men at intervals to
back-fire as far down the ridge as they could stand the heat. If anything, the
fire seemed bigger than it had the night before,&mdash;a maelstrom of the
inferno.</p>

<p>They worked in pairs, Ace being his, Norris&#8217;s, <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104'></a>104</span>right hand man.
He now assorted the six miners along the slope, planning himself to take the
extreme Western post, where the ridge ran lowest and where the rocky crest
dwindled to a dangerous line of mountain pines.</p>

<p>Ted and Pedro he directed to the opposite end of the ridge, where, like the
tooth of a comb, it joined the main crest of the Sierra,&mdash;another strategic
point.</p>

<p>&#8220;If worst comes to worst,&#8221; his final words were, &#8220;take refuge in some
cave. This is a limestone region,&mdash;as you may have noticed,&mdash;and it&#8217;s likely
riddled with caves. Keep an eye out for indications of cave mouths. I saw one
yesterday, somewhere down there, when I didn&#8217;t have time to investigate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; acquiesced the boys, though inwardly scorning the
possibility.</p>

<p>Rosa remained at camp to have food ready for the men on their return.</p>

<p>She began by taking stock. There was flour and lard, but no bread. She would
have to bake for eleven hungry men. There were rice, beans, onions and tomatoes,
dried fruits and coffee, and fresh meat for one meal, and for the next,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105'></a>105</span>erbwurst and pickles, macaroni to be baked with cheese, and tea.
She hoped&mdash;for more reasons than one&mdash;that the Ranger would bring more supplies.
She got out the Dutch oven and the gallon coffee pot, and with the hatchet
provided with the outfit, started getting in a supply of down-wood.</p>

<p>As on the day of the rodeo, she was attired in trim khaki riding breeches and
high-heeled moccasin boots,&mdash;good on horse-back but mighty hard to walk in,
where the ground was rough. Her bobbed curly hair, red silk blouse and fringed
sash added a touch of the Rosa that underlay her gritty side. She would surprise
Radcliffe with her ability to cook for a fire crew.</p>

<p>The huge loaf safely ensconced in a Dutch oven buried in red coals, she
sallied forth on a little exploring expedition. She wished she might find some
fir sugar to cap the feast. She had, once, when camping in the Thompson River
Valley. She had found the delectable sweet on a Douglas fir. Some of the dry
white masses had been all of two inches long, though most of it had been in the
form of mere white drops at the tips of the needles. There had also been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106'></a>106</span>a quantity of it in a semi-liquid condition on the ground
underneath the tree, where some rain had dissolved it from the branches.</p>

<p>Just where should she search? The Indians had told her that time to look on
the dry Eastern slopes of the range, in open areas where the trees got lots of
sunlight, but where the ground has not dried out too quickly after the spring
rains, as moisture is necessary as well as sunlight,&mdash;(so long as it does not
rain and melt off this excess of the tree&#8217;s digested starch). She had a hunch
that she could find some on the desert side of the Sierras, that being, of
course, unattainable&mdash;unless Ace could take her over in his &#8217;plane. It would do
no harm to look on this side.</p>

<p>Neither did it do any good. She returned to camp empty-handed save for some
cones of the sugar pine, which she proceeded to roast that the nuts might fall
out of the spiny masses.</p>

<p>She found the deserted camp over-run with chipmunks. The little striped
rascals had ravaged all the food supplies they could nibble into. She watched a
couple of them actually shoving on the tin lid that she had left insecurely
loose on the syrup can. Finally sending it clattering <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107'></a>107</span>to the stony
ground,&mdash;as she watched from behind two trees that grew close together,&mdash;the wee
things sat up there on the edge of the can, dipping out its contents with their
hand-like paws and licking them. Then one tried to reach down and drink it
outright, at which he fell in, and Rosa felt impelled to fish him out and
launder him,&mdash;to his terror,&mdash;before turning him loose, then put the syrup on
the fire to sterilize.</p>

<p>Meantime what of the fire fighters? Ted and Pedro, with their pick and
shovel, had descended rapidly into that deathly silence of the doomed forest
slopes, deserted alike by song birds and chipmunks, the hum of insects and sound
of any living thing, save alone the never-ceasing roar of the ravenous
flames.</p>

<p>The fire had been eating slowly through a stretch of manzanita chaparral,
whose hard stems resisted them as the evergreens could not. Though the wind
still blew up-canyon, they approached the river gorge at right angles, and were
able to make their way to the lower levels in the shelter of the East side of a
dry creek bed, where the hot blast could not reach them.</p>

<p>They were stooping to drink at a spring when the terrified neigh of a horse
sounded from a <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108'></a>108</span>clump of saplings almost behind them. In the same
instant the stretch of seedling firs that clothed the creek bank, showering into
sparks at the far end, shot toward them sky rockets of leaping flame. Turning in
a panic to race out at right angles from this unexpected peril, they thought to
make time on horse-back. The animal was tied and hobbled with a rawhide
lariat!</p>

<p>Frantically the hobbled horse jerked at the rawhide.</p>

<p>Pedro plucked Ted by the arm and tried to drag him on, for the fire was
snapping through the under-brush at the speed of an express train. Its sound
was that of many trains, and its wind hot as the breath of a blast furnace.</p>

<p>But as Ted had stooped to cut the thongs, his parched nostrils had caught a
cooler breath. It seemed to issue from a cranny in the rocks behind the clump of
saplings. Then it was too late: The shooting tongues of red were upon them.
Dragging Pedro down beside him,&mdash;for the roar drowned his voice,&mdash;he waited,
reasoning that the two- or three-foot seedlings would go like tinder, leaving a
strip of ground hot, to be sure, but no longer flaming.</p>

<p>If they could but endure its passing! He <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109'></a>109</span>turned to press his
scorched face against the rock wall.</p>

<p>To his amazement, he fell into a cave mouth, tripping Pedro, who stumbled
after him. Quick as thought they dragged the horse in after them and held him,
trembling and snorting, his eyes rolling wildly, during that blistering moment
until the line of fire had passed them.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re safer now than before,&#8221; declared Ted. &#8220;This made a fine
back-fire, didn&#8217;t it?&mdash;Let&#8217;s rest awhile.&#8221; His nerves were taking toll of
him. &#8220;Ground&#8217;s too <i>hot yet</i> anyway.&#8221;</p>

<p>For perhaps an hour they rested, flat on the floor of the cave,&mdash;after having
tied the horse to a bowlder just outside. He was a fine animal, black as jet and
as high-spirited as Spitfire himself. Ted appraised him with longing eyes, for
he loved horses as Ace loved his ship. But who could he belong to, and how did
he come to be there?</p>

<p>His bridle was embellished with silver. &#8220;Mexican handiwork, that!&#8221; Pedro
thought. But the mystery was no nearer solution.</p>

<p>The answer came sooner than they expected.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110'></a>110</span>
<p class='cln0'>CHAPTER VI</p>
<p class='cln1'>THE INCENDIARIES</p>
</div>

<p>The red glow of the sun on the snow-clad peaks of the main ridge had begun
glinting through the smoke gloom when voices seemed to echo from within the very
rock against which they were leaning. The boys crept to look behind it. Then
their eyes rounded in astonishment. As Ted would have spoken, Pedro clapped his
hand over his mouth with a look that bade silence. Crouched motionless at the
side of the cave mouth,&mdash;for a deep cave it now disclosed itself,&mdash;the two boys
peered at the spectacle that greeted their eyes.</p>

<p>Three Mexicans, aglitter with the silver buttons of their native costume,
appeared suddenly from some black depth, carrying torches.</p>

<p>With these one of their number kindled a bon-fire, whose flame revealed a
couple of burros standing patiently under their packs, tied to a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111'></a>111</span>mammoth stalagmite. For the red flare behind the three figures of
the Mexicans, showed a cave roofed with amber-tinted icicles of smoke-stained
rock, beneath which up-rose for each a pyramid of the same formation.</p>

<p>The Mexicans might have been father and son and old servant, from their
general appearance and from the fact that most of the work of supper-getting was
performed by the shabby, white-haired one, while the fat middle-aged one struck
the younger a blow that was not reciprocated. They were talking in a tongue that
Ted could not translate, though from the peppery tone of it, he judged they were
quarreling. Pedro assured him later they were not. (He knew Mexican.) They were
merely regretting that their horse had been burned.</p>

<p>The fat one, evidently too fagged to move, was demanding that one of the
others go see for sure, while they argued that it was no use, the animal could
not have survived. They must have been exhausted, lame, besides, to judge from
the creaky way they moved. The fat one poured some verbal vitriol on their heads
for not having brought the horse inside, while the <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112'></a>112</span>white haired one
deprecated that they had not intended to be gone so long.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the fat one&#8217;s, and now he&#8217;ll have to hoof it like the others; he&#8217;d
sure break the back of a burro,&#8221; translated Pedro in huge enjoyment, to his
mystified companion. &#8220;Wonder if they&#8217;re the fire bugs Rosa saw?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s listen and find out,&#8221; said Ted.</p>

<p>As the blaze by which they dried their mysteriously muddy feet died down to
red coals, from the pack of one of the burros the old peon extracted some
ready-made tamales and proceeded to add the heat of cooking to the hotter
peppers within their enwrapping corn husks. This fiery mixture they quenched
from a round-bellied bottle passed from lip to lip, though the fat one took his
first and longest.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re the fire bugs, all right,&#8221; said Pedro softly into Ted&#8217;s ear.
And it was agreed that they might safely creep in along the shadows till Pedro
could hear more plainly.</p>

<p>Sanchez was the name of the fat leader, and his son and his servant the
others proved to be. They had, it developed, a grouch against the lumber company
down on the Kawa, (in which, as it happened, Ace&#8217;s father had an interest).
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113'></a>113</span>They had been fired from the crew, and no punishment was too great
for a company that would do that to a workman who merely asked his accustomed
afternoon siesta.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Detestablemente!</i>&#8221; (And other remarks that sounded like
fire-works.) The pigs of <i>Americanoes!</i> Pedro convulsed Ted with his
recital when they had crept back to the cave mouth, despite the seriousness of
the situation.</p>

<p>That they would start more fires at their first opportunity had also been
established by their conversation.</p>

<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t let &#8217;em go,&#8221; argued the ranch boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t capture them,&#8221; the Castilian was as positive. &#8220;We are
unarmed, and they have their daggers.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ted pondered, peered out at the still, smoking ground, soothed the nervous
horse, then came to a conclusion, which he unfolded to his comrade.</p>

<p>He must go for help. He would ride that horse, find Norris, get Ace to
wireless Radcliffe, and summon help. But&mdash;he eyed Pedro doubtfully, knowing his
uncourageous bearing at the rodeo.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114'></a>114</span>&#8220;But what?&#8221; insisted the Spanish boy. But had he not
guessed it! Of course he would remain behind to keep track of the
desperadoes.</p>

<p>But how could Ted start with the ground so hot? He would have to wait awhile,
then make up for lost time by break-neck riding.</p>

<p>So be it. They were hungry now, and ate the ration of tinned corned beef and
hardtack from their pockets. Ted also fed the horse some hardtack, and brought
him several hatfuls of water from the spring,&mdash;scorching his soles as he crossed
the charred ground.</p>

<p>Pedro propped his tired body in a sitting posture with one ear cocked for the
conversation within. Ted flung himself flat on his back in the smoky gloom,
which obscured even the light of the moon. He was mentally exploring that
cave,&mdash;remembering what Norris had once told them of the region and wondering
into what limed recesses the Mexicans were likely to retire when capture
threatened. That the cave had its depths he felt assured by their having so
suddenly appeared with their torches. And what could Pedro do if they tried to
leave before help came?&mdash;My, but he must ride! Three such incendiaries loose in
those dry forests, and <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115'></a>115</span>there would be no end to the harm they could
do!</p>

<p>The limestone of which these caves were formed,&mdash;sediment of the shells of
myriads of sea creatures,&mdash;had been deposited in the primeval ocean that once
flowed over that whole region from the Gulf of California. Uplifted by
contractions of the earth crust, it had been cut as the surrounding granite
could not have been by the percolating rains and streams, flowing along the
cracks of the uplift.</p>

<p>This cave was probably a network of water-worn passage-ways extending no
telling how far underneath the ridge. There were reputed to be caves almost as
large as Mammoth in these unexplored recesses of the Southern Sierras. Could
this be one of them, or was it just a two- or three-cavern affair, he wondered?
On that depended a very great deal of their success in the coming capture, for
once entrenched within these labyrinthian caves, the Mexicans could hold them at
bay until they had made good their get-away. It had been so, he had been told by
military men, in chasing Mexicans over the border.</p>

<p>Perhaps there were other caves in the region. <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116'></a>116</span>Where, indeed, had
these men secreted themselves while the fire had raged in a semi-circle about
them? In a cave, the air would be damp and cool, no matter what was going on
outside, and they could have been genuinely comfortable with the inferno raging
over their very heads. Unless, of course, the smoke suffocated them! That would
all depend on the air passages that fed their particular cavern. Some of those
caves across the Mexican border were miles in extent, and had exits galore.</p>

<p>Pondering the pendant stalactites that had gleamed like onyx in the
firelight, he pictured the water percolating drop by drop through the limestone
crevices, dissolving the lime and forming the stalactites a drop at a time
through the years. How wonderful it was! He wished he too might study. Perhaps,
if he could make a go of his mother&#8217;s fruit ranch?&mdash;He was half asleep. He
roused himself by trying to recall what it was that Norris had told them about
stalactites.</p>

<p>The rain water, charged with the carbonic acid gas of the atmosphere, seeps
in from the surface and falls drop by drop. Each slow drop remains long enough
upon the ceiling to deposit <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117'></a>117</span>some of its dissolved lime in a ring to
which the next succeeding drop adds another layer.</p>

<p>In time this ring lengthens into a pipe-stem of soft lime. It fills and
crystallizes, thickens and elongates, as the constant drip, evaporating from the
outside, deposits more and more of the lime. Thus these stone icicles are
formed, sometimes an inch a year.</p>

<p>At the same time the drops that fall to the floor, solidifying one at a time,
build up a slender pyramid beneath,&mdash;a stalagmite,&mdash;which reaches higher and
higher as its stalactite hangs lower and lower. In time these two formations
meet in a slender pillar, the pillar thickens through the same slow process and
if the pillars stand close enough together,&mdash;as where the drip follows a long
rock fissure,&mdash;the pillars will eventually join in a solid partition.</p>

<p>This <i>dripstone</i>, as the material of the formation is termed, began as
soft carbonate of lime; it hardens into <i>gypsum</i> or, sometimes, alabaster,
or calcite.</p>

<p>The boy peered once more into the carved gallery, waiting till an up-flare of
the dying fire again illumined the fantastic ceiling, whose fairy architecture
gleamed opalescent in the <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118'></a>118</span>orange glow. He thought of the old fairy
tales of gnomes hammering on their golden anvils in their jeweled caves in the
hearts of the mountains, and wondered if such lore had not arisen from the fact
of just such cave formations, coupled with the echoes the slightest sound set to
reverberating. After all, most folk tales had some foundation.</p>

<p>Once these Mexicans were captured and the forest fire brought under control,
he meant to ask Norris if their camping expedition might not include an
exploration of some of the caves he had assured them honeycombed this part of
the Sierra.</p>

<p>He little dreamed in what fantastic fashion his wish was to come about, as he
lay there waiting till he could start his ride for help!</p>

<p>Nor did Pedro, drowsing, exhausted, beside him, dream of the test that was to
be made of his courage while he remained behind. He seemed so fagged that Ted
did not even wake him, when at last he deemed it time to sally forth.</p>

<p>Ted loved nothing better than a good horse.</p>

<p>The plainsman, he used to argue, may have his twin six, the airman his ship,
but for the <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119'></a>119</span>outdoor man, give him the comrade who can take the
mountain trails, the needle carpeted forest floor, the unbridged streams, the
glacier polished slopes.</p>

<p>The black horse wore the high Visalia saddle, against which his rider could
rest on steep grades. It would be more dangerous, should the animal throw him,
though of course the high horn would help him to pull leather should need arise.
He had lengthened the stirrups, Western fashion, till his long legs dangled
easily and he could have raised himself scarce an inch above the saddle by
standing in his stirrups. His long, lean legs would give him a good hold where
the going was rough, and if he had only a quirt, or even a pair of drop-shank
spurs, he would have felt confident of making time. (For he knew how to use the
spurs so that they would not torture his animal.) He regretted that the
mysterious owner had not fitted the poor brute with the old spade bit, for
should the horse fall, on the uneven ground, it would be likely to cut his mouth
badly. He had once seen an animal bleed to death from such a hurt. Well, they
must not fall!</p>

<p>Mechanically he opened the reins, as was his <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120'></a>120</span>habit:&mdash;His own
horse had been trained to hitch to the ground, and all he had to do when he
dismounted in a hurry was to drop rein. He was glad to find that the saddle was
rim fire, (or double-rigged), as it would stay in place, no matter what
acrobatics they might be forced to perform. So far, so good!</p>

<p>With right hand on the saddle horn, left grasping rein and mane, he swung up,
and before ever he touched leather, they were off.</p>

<p>Would his mount prove broncho? Had his probably Mexican owner uglied his
disposition? That remained to be discovered. And on that detail would depend
much of the success of his race for help. For with Norris at the far end of the
ridge, there would be several hours of tough going, he surmised.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir, you shore gotta <i>slope</i> some!&#8221; he told the mustang, in
imitation of the cow-men. &#8220;Or those Greasers will just naturally fade out of
the landscape.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the night wind blew the smoke down canyon, he could very nearly tell his
way, and the time as well, by the stars. Being early in July, he knew that in
the constellation of Hercules, almost directly above, the hero&#8217;s head pointed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121'></a>121</span>South. It was something Norris had told them one night when they
had to travel late to find a fit camping spot. The crest of the ridge lay South,
and along the crest he should find more open going. He would then have to veer
to the West. As Venus rose brilliantly in the East, he knew he had now about two
hours and a half till sunrise.</p>

<p>Breasting the wind, he headed around the twisting stems of unyielding
manzanita, then up, straight South, over slide rock and fallen tree trunks,
turning aside for only the larger bowlders. The mountain-bred horse was lithe as
a greyhound, as he alternately climbed and slid, or made wide leaps over the
uneven slope.</p>

<p>The ridge attained, however, he found it harder going than he had imagined,
by reason of the broken shale, weathered by the frost of unnumbered winters. But
just on the other side,&mdash;that furthest from the fire zone,&mdash;stretched a smooth
granite slope, where the going would be unobstructed. But these smooth slopes,
bed of that prehistoric river of ice, slanted slowly but surely to the cascading
mountain stream whose roar now assailed his ears. One slip on that smooth
surface and his horse <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122'></a>122</span>would never stop till he had reached the
rapids! The boy wondered if the animal were sufficiently sure-footed. The answer
would mean, at the very least, the difference between a broken leg and a sound
one, for the boy speeding to secure help in the capture of the fire bugs. But
there seemed a fighting chance, and he would take it.</p>

<p>At intervals the granite was blocked out by cracks, and he found the slight
unevenness of a crack lent his mount a surer footing. At times it was fairly
level and he ventured a gallop; again it was precarious even at a walk.</p>

<p>Suddenly a monotonous &#8220;chick-chick-chick&#8221; buzzed beneath their feet. The
horse leapt violently to one side,&mdash;just in time to evade the coiled spring of
four feet of green-black rattlesnake, on whose sinister form he had all but
trod. By that instant leap he had avoided the speedy death of the injected virus
of the stroke. Ted&#8217;s heart was in his mouth.</p>

<p>On&mdash;on&mdash;on he urged the black. It became mechanical; he ceased to think.
Exhausted alike by his long vigil and the strain he had been under, he now sat
his horse in a daze, just keeping his nose generally Westward, while he skirted
the crest of the ridge. He felt half <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123'></a>123</span>numb as he rounded the end of
the crest where Norris was to have been stationed. To his stupefaction, the
fire fighters had completed their trench and gone!</p>

<p>Where could they be? Probably back at the camp, which he had skirted by this
detour, never dreaming he would find any one but Rosa there. Well,&mdash;he was
&#8220;outa luck!&#8221; Back he went the way he had come, till he thought it time to
climb the ridge. A flare of cook-fire through the graying dawn showed him where
to head, and the huge sun was just slipping blood-red through the smoke gloom as
he took the last log at a leap and dropped off beside the moving figures.</p>

<p>The men were all there,&mdash;as was Ranger Radcliffe, whom the DeHaviland had
evidently returned with fresh supplies. It took but few words to acquaint them
with the situation.</p>

<p>By the time Ted had drank a quart of coffee with his breakfast, he was able
to pull himself together again and lead the possé to the hidden cave mouth. The
Ranger would have to be the one to go, to make the arrest, and he deputized Ace
to help him. That meant leaving Norris to head the firemen. (It never occurred
to any of <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124'></a>124</span>them that they would not be right back with Pedro and the
Mexicans. The foam-flecked horse Ted left to Rosa&#8217;s care.)</p>

<p>The cave mouth accomplished, Radcliffe entered first, with revolver cocked,
though Ace almost trod on his heels. Ted staggered after with a flaming pine
knot flickering in his almost nerveless hand.</p>

<p>The cavern was absolutely empty!</p>

<p>To Pedro, left in the cave mouth to watch the Mexicans, the night had been
the crucial test.</p>

<p>He had been asleep when Ted departed, while the Mexicans had slept within the
cave. He awoke to find the three dark visages bending over him, their verbal
fireworks hissing about his ears. At first &#8220;caballo&#8221; was all he could make
of it,&mdash;(the horse). Then as Sanchez the stout, soared rhetorically above the
others, he gathered that they dared not leave him and they could not carry him.
&#8220;El Diablo!&#8221; How much simpler to thrust a dagger between his ribs.
&#8220;Muerte!&mdash;Presto!&#8221; But no, wait! For the time being he would walk between
them carrying two extra torches. There must be another exit to the cave, but
could the burros make <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125'></a>125</span>it with the packs? Try it they must, for this
way their choice lay between the fire fighters and the flames. The doomed forest
still glowed red and black down canyon, and with the morning light, the wind
veered till the smoke assailed them chokingly. There was no time to be lost.</p>

<p>Never for an instant dreaming that Pedro understood, they gave him the
torches he was to bear, and started into the depths of the cavern. And the boy?
Too frightened at first to have spoken had he tried to, he had the wit to see
that protest would be useless. They were three to one, armed, and desperate, and
they counted him a likely witness to their incendiarism.</p>

<p>Besides, now that the wind had changed, he could not have gone ten paces
without having been blinded by the smoke till he could not see where he was
heading. This side of the canyon was going to go like tinder, too.
Besides,&mdash;this came later,&mdash;how could he allow the fire bugs to get away? His
job was to keep tabs on them, and that he would now have an exceptional
opportunity to do, he cheered himself.</p>

<p>At first the flare of the torches revealed merely the cavern of onyx
stalactites he had <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126'></a>126</span>seen the night before. This formation wound in a
narrowing labyrinth until they made a sharp turn to the left. Presently they
came to a pit of inky water, around which they had to skirt on a sloping shelf.
The burros could not make it and they left them there. Either, Pedro argued,
they meant to return that way or else they had other supplies awaiting
them. But now they could no longer smell the smoke. From somewhere came pure
air, damp and refreshingly chilly. The sounds of the outer world were cut off
completely. On and on they wandered as in a dream. Pedro began surreptitiously
pinching himself to make sure he was not having some weird nightmare.</p>

<p>They came to a grotto that might have been brown marble, whose curious
carvings he had no time to study. From this they had to crawl on hands and knees
through an opening into another twisting passageway, floored with muddy water
and barely high enough for them to stand erect. Their voices echoed and
reechoed. Then came arches of stalactites almost meeting the stalagmites beneath
them, through which they edged their way as through a frozen forest.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127'></a>127</span>This opened into a vast cavern hung as with icicles of
alabaster, which their torch light warmed to onyx.</p>

<p>&#8220;If these fellows weren&#8217;t so free with their knives,&#8221; Pedro told
himself, &#8220;it would be an adventure worth having. But they certainly have too
much dynamite in their dispositions to suit me,&#8221;&mdash;for the Mexicans were now
quarreling among themselves. The boy and the old man were for turning back
before they lost themselves,&mdash;for at every turn there were branching ways.</p>

<p>But Sanchez, the heavy-handed, was for going on,&mdash;and on they went, shivering
in the unaccustomed chill.</p>

<p>Pedro wondered what the rescue party would do when they found them gone. If
only he could leave some sign of his whereabouts! Could he drop his handkerchief
at one turning of the ways, his hat at another, without detection? Or was it
already too late? Why had he not thought of that before?&mdash;Tucking one torch into
the crook of the other elbow for a moment, he dropped his bandanna as again they
took the left-hand of two turns.</p>

<p>But now their little flare of light revealed a <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128'></a>128</span>blind passageway.
The water-worn rock had been hollowed out by some eddying pool, no doubt, while
the main stream had flown on past. How he wished he knew more of cave
formations! Should he find opportunity to escape, how would he ever find his way
out again?</p>

<p>Retracing their steps, they took the right hand turn. Here was another high
roofed vault,&mdash;he could not see how high, he could only guess from the
reverberation of their voices,&mdash;whose stalactites had become great pillars that
gleamed yellowly. The floor sloped toward them till they had stiff climbing. On
one wall was a limestone formation like a frozen cataract. And thrust into the
wall beside it he saw a torch stick. Who had left it there, and what ages ago,
he wondered? In this cavern some of the stalactites hung as huge as tree trunks,
and had not Sanchez bade the others keep an extra eye on him, the lad might
easily have hid behind one.</p>

<p>Some of these huge pillars were cracked with age, and again the thought
occurred to him that if only he might insert himself into one of the cracks,&mdash;a
few were all of a foot in width,&mdash;he could easily escape detection in that
uncertain <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129'></a>129</span>light. But now he was under surveillance every instant.
Besides, (tardy thought), was he not pledged to keep an eye on the villains? He
smiled through his fears at the recollection that they, not he, were
captive.</p>

<p>Meantime Ace and Radcliffe, (leaving Ted to sleep off his exhaustion in the
cave mouth), were examining the onyx cavern and the ground outside for some sign
as to what had happened, and which way Pedro and the Mexicans had gone.
Radcliffe had his electric flash, and at the turn of the winding passageway
discovered scratches on the sandstone floor where the burros had left hoof
marks. But had they taken the turn to the right or that to the left? There were
hoof prints both going and coming, in each passageway. Which had been made the
more recently? They could not tell.</p>

<p>Ace hoped that the Ranger would propose each following a different direction,
but instead, Radcliffe remarked that they ought to have brought a ball of twine
to unwind as they went, as people had been known to get lost in unknown caves,
and stay lost for days. The best alternative was to make a rough map of their
turnings in his note-book.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130'></a>130</span>They advanced along the right hand passageway, whose breath
seemed like that of another world from that of the parched mountain side,&mdash;cool
and moist and wonderfully exhilarating. Had it not been for his uneasiness as to
Pedro&#8217;s whereabouts, Ace would have enjoyed this expedition into the unexplored.
His was a nature that craved the tang of adventure, even more than most. It was
one of the things that had led him to take up geology, for in the U. S.
Geological Survey his life would lead him, likely, to far places.</p>

<p>He wished, though, that Ted were with them. A good pal certainly doubles
one&#8217;s enjoyments.</p>

<p>They had gone what seemed like miles, (though cave miles are deceptive, so
completely is one cut off from space and time), bearing always to the right,
when Radcliffe&#8217;s light suddenly burned out, leaving them in primeval darkness.
At first breath they tried to laugh at their predicament, then the utter
blackness seemed to press upon them till it suffocated, and Ace suppressed a
sudden desire to scream. His panic moment was dissipated by Radcliffe&#8217;s
discovery of a bit of candle. Ace had, of course, that most important part of a
camper&#8217;s <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131'></a>131</span>equipment, a waterproof match-box, linked to his belt, and
in it a few matches. But even then it meant going back the way they had come,
for without a good light they could do nothing. Perhaps it was just as well, for
they were bound on no hour&#8217;s adventure, and should have brought food as well.
How Radcliffe wished he had his acetylene lamp!</p>

<p>To their surprise they found Norris at the cave mouth trying to arrange his
coat under the sleeping Ted. And around him lay the coiled lariat he had taken
from the saddle-horn of Ted&#8217;s recent mount, also three canteens, some cooked
food, and a supply of hard candles from the fire crew supplies. There were also
the boys&#8217; sweaters,&mdash;Radcliffe, of course, had his woolen uniform,&mdash;and to cap
the climax, a ball of twine and the Ranger&#8217;s pet lamp, with its tin of carbide
powder.</p>

<p>To their amazed query Norris explained that he had explored dozens of caves
in his time, including some hundreds of miles of that honeycomb formation that
underlies a portion of Kentucky, to say nothing of the caverns of the Shenandoah
Valley of Virginia, the Black Hills of South Dakota, and the Ozarks. Of the
caves <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132'></a>132</span>of California, however, he as yet knew nothing.</p>

<p>Had he not been needed to head the fire crew, he would have loved nothing
better than to have gone with them.</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew this was a cave region,&#8221; he told them as they ate and refreshed
themselves before going back into the black depths&mdash;for they had been gone
several hours, it seemed. &#8220;Fissured limestone&mdash;I noticed it yesterday when we
were down here trying to backfire. Then what feeds the Kawa? Not these little
flood creeks that dry up almost before the spring floods are over. Where does
all that snow water go to? Some underground passageway, of course. It seeps
through the porous rock to subterranean channels. By the way, I see there are
tracks of muddy feet inside here, and <i>your</i> feet are dry! The mud must
have been left by the Mexicans.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a fact!&#8221; exclaimed Radcliffe. &#8220;Ace, did you notice any mud
along that passageway? Then we surely took the wrong turn.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not necessarily,&#8221; said Norris. &#8220;They might have <i>come</i> from some
muddy cavern, but gone back another way. However, I was going to give you a
little idea of the probable layout of a cave. This one, if&mdash;as I suspect&mdash;it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133'></a>133</span>feeds the Kawa&mdash;likely descends to other levels, till the lowest
one is very nearly on that of the river. Seeping through, here and there, the
rains and melting snows probably collect into a stream.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wish you could go with us, old chap,&#8221; said the Ranger.
&#8220;But<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll get along all right, with these things,&#8221; sighed Norris, &#8220;and
if you don&#8217;t show up again within a few hours, we&#8217;ll follow your twine,&#8221; and
he tied one end of the cord ball to a manzanita bush, handing the ball to Ace.
At that moment Ted awoke and insisted that he join them. Norris reluctantly
returned to the fire crew.</p>

<p class='cln0'>CHAPTER VII</p>
<p class='cln1'>THE CAVE</p>
</div>

<p>Electing the turn to the left, Radcliffe led the way with his carbide lamp.
Ace and Ted followed with their candles.</p>

<p>This time their choice was quickly verified by the discovery of the burros,
standing patiently with their packs before the pool. (That accounted for the
muddy footprints.) Skirting this on the shelving ledge as had Pedro and the
Mexicans, they traversed the winding passageway that led to the grotto of brown
cauliflower-like encrustations. But here, when they found that the left-hand
passageway meant going on hands and knees, they chose the other turn. (They came
that near to catching up with the fugitives!)</p>

<p>With the suddenness of events in a dream, they came into a vast chamber that
at first <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135'></a>135</span>glimpse, lighted as it was by the carbide lamp, gave the
impression of a baronial ruin. The boys whistled simultaneously under their
breath. At the far end stood a huge stone elephant,&mdash;or so it appeared at the
first startled glance,&mdash;and beside him a gnome and several weird beasts vaguely
reminiscent of the monsters of prehistoric times.</p>

<p>When Ted could speak, he whispered, &#8220;What are they? Fossils?&#8221;</p>

<p>Ace laughed. &#8220;I should say not. They&#8217;re nothing but dripstone, can&#8217;t you
see?&mdash;They&#8217;d be &#8216;some fossils&#8217;! Why, if we could find just one fossil as
big as that, our fortunes would be made&mdash;absolutely.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee! Then I&#8217;m sure going to keep my eyes peeled.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought,&#8221; put in Radcliffe, &#8220;that fossils were little stone worms.
I&#8217;ve found those aplenty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fossils,&#8221; explained Ace, (fresh from first-year geology), &#8220;are any
remains of plants or animals that lived, either on land or in the sea, in
ancient times. A lot of those we find to-day were shell-fish and other marine
life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee!&#8221; grinned Ted, &#8220;doesn&#8217;t he talk like a <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136'></a>136</span>professor?
I&#8217;m going to call you professor after this, old Scout!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go on,&#8221; the Ranger urged, ignoring this sally, &#8220;I&#8217;m
interested.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So am I, honestly,&#8221; amended Ted contritely.</p>

<p>&#8220;There were land animals, too, that got buried in the accumulating
sediments and fossilized. Times when the ocean over-ran the land, they got
drifted into it, and sank, and got buried under the sands that made our
sandstones<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This floor is sandstone!&#8221; interpolated Ted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. Or they got buried in the ground-up shells that made our
limestone,&mdash;like the walls of the cave,&mdash;or some of them were buried in
mud.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose,&#8221; offered Ted facetiously, &#8220;that the mud made
mudstones,&#8221; and he laughed till his voice echoed and reëchoed
startlingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha, ha! You&#8217;re right!&#8221; Ace turned the laugh on him. &#8220;Go to the head
of the class. I&#8217;ll show you mudstone when we come to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, then,&#8221; ventured the Ranger, &#8220;this must be a topping place to
find fossils.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Provided,&#8221; Ace admitted, &#8220;the cave is not <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137'></a>137</span>of too recent
formation. But as I was about to say,&#8221; (seeing their undoubted interest),
&#8220;geologists can just about piece together the history of the earth from the
fossils that have been found, but no one locality gives it all. They have found
part of the story in America and part in Africa, and parts in Europe and Asia.
And from that series of fossils&mdash;and some other evidence&mdash;scientists have about
agreed that since the earth was formed, about twenty whole mountain ranges, one
after another, must have been formed and worn away almost to sea level.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do they make that out?&#8221; Ted looked skeptical.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s another long story. I&#8217;m no professor. But<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t prove it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Neither can you disprove it, any more than you can the conclusions on
which astronomy, higher mathematics, any of the sciences&mdash;are based.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose so! Gee, I&#8217;d like to study those things for myself!&#8221; sighed
Ted, seating himself beside the others on a dry ledge while they ate their
sandwiches.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138'></a>138</span>&#8220;Find a valuable fossil and you&#8217;ve earned a college
education,&#8221; Ace challenged him. &#8220;And you know, fossils are not necessarily
fish or insects or skeletons or tree trunks that have been turned to
stone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To stone?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By the removal of their own tissues and replacement by mineral matter. A
fossil may be merely the print of a leaf of some prehistoric plant on sandstone,
or the footprint of some antediluvian reptile. In the National Museum they have
a cast of a prehistoric shad that shows the imprint of every bone and fin
ray.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How on earth could that have been formed?&#8221; marveled Ted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, it was simply buried in fine mud, which first protects it from the
air, (and consequent immediate decay), then gradually fills every pore of every
bone, till by the time the mud has turned to stone, the bones are ossified. Of
course the animal matter has all dissolved away by this time. Now if this mud
that filled the pores happened to be silica, (a sandy formation), it is possible
to eat the surrounding limestone away with acids and uncover the silica
formation, see, old kid?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139'></a>139</span>&#8220;Aw, that stuff makes my head ache,&#8221; protested Tim. &#8220;If I
see any ossified bones lying around, or even a footprint or leaf print in the
stone, I&#8217;ll know I&#8217;ve found a fossil. But I thought we were chasing
fire-bugs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The impatience of youth!&#8221; Ace playfully squelched him, from the vantage
point of his slight seniority.</p>

<p>&#8220;What does the Bible say,&#8221; laughed the Ranger, &#8220;about truth from the
mouths of babes?&#8221; And he arose a bit stiffly,&mdash;for he had had a strenuous
time of it the past few days, and the cave damp had set his tired limbs to
aching.</p>

<p>For upwards of an hour they followed dark and winding passageways, (rats and
lizards and occasional colonies of bats fleeing before them), naturally without
the slightest sign of the fugitives, when they came to another grotto, the
loveliest they had yet seen. It might have been a fairy cavern, aglitter with
pure crystal. The carved prisms shone dazzlingly in the light of the carbide
lamp, and the boys stuffed their pockets with some of the jewel-like bits that
had fallen to the floor.</p>

<p>From this they presently entered into what <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140'></a>140</span>seemed like a Gothic
cathedral, with a dome whose highest point must have been several hundred feet
above. The boys were fairly awed by its beauty, while the Ranger&#8217;s eyes gleamed
appreciatively. On the walls were what might have been carvings of flowers and
lacework, creamy to smoke color, gypsum, Ace told them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are these fossils?&#8221; demanded Ted excitedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should say not, you poor fish!&mdash;You ichthyosaurus,&#8221; laughed Ace
teasingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You what?&#8221; asked the Ranger.</p>

<p>&#8220;That means ancient fish.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; grinned Ted. &#8220;If I&#8217;m an ich<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ich-thy-o-saur-us?&#8221; Radcliffe came to his rescue.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you&#8217;re a dinosaur,&#8221; grinned Ted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, here, stop calling each other names!&#8221; commanded Radcliffe. &#8220;And
perhaps Ace will tell us about this gypsum formation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thunder! Wish Norris was here! I tell you I&#8217;m no professor. But if you&#8217;re
after fossils, don&#8217;t you remember what he told us, that day just before we lost
the pack burro?&mdash;That in this part of California we have rock from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141'></a>141</span>the Cambrian era a mile thick, and I&#8217;ll bet it&#8217;s full of fossils of
the fish age!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Radcliffe briskly interposed, as they came to another turn,
&#8220;we&#8217;ll never find those Mexicans unless we separate and hunt faster than we&#8217;ve
been doing. Are you fellows game for taking one way while I go back to that last
turn and try the left hand passageway? Of course the instant you get wind of
them, report back to me.&#8221; They signified their gameness by picking a
precarious footing, (Ted first), along the slippery floor, their candles thrust
in their hat bands.</p>

<p>Above they came to another but a smaller forest of alabaster stalactites,
shining like icicles or mosses, some white as snow, some yellow as gold, and
some so like maple sugar in appearance that Ace actually tasted it. In one place
there was a bit of what Ace said was needle gypsum, that hung as fine as
fur.</p>

<p>Radcliffe, retracing his steps, (with the aid of the twine ball), till he
came to the cross roads, as it were, turned to the left and forged ahead with
his carbide lamp, treading softly as a cougar, with revolver cocked in his right
hand. Ever and anon he stopped breath-still to listen.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142'></a>142</span>Passing through the same alabaster cavern that had so impressed
the Spanish boy, his eye caught the bandanna Pedro had dropped in the left-hand
passageway. With an inward exclamation, he hurried on till he had reached the
end of the blind. Stooping with his lamp, he could see the fresh scratches their
feet had made. Darting back to the turn of the tunnel, where he had picked up
the bandanna, he took the only choice left to him, the right hand way, with all
the satisfaction of a hound on the scent. More scratches on the sandstone floor
assured him that they had really gone this way, instead of turning back the way
they had come, and presently he too was standing in the gallery of the sloping
floor and yellowed pillars, at whose far end the dripstone cataract hung, turned
to soundless stone. But of the three Mexicans and Pedro there was no trace.</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, when do we eat?&#8221; Ace was just beginning, when the floor suddenly
gave way beneath him, and he fell down a ten foot well, landing on all fours, in
Stygian blackness. And no sooner had his bulk padded the stone beneath than Ted
came, plunk! almost on top of him.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143'></a>143</span>At the moment both were slightly stunned. Their candle flames
had of course been flicked out. Then Ted reached mechanically for his matches,
by whose flare he found his hat, and still firmly stuffed into the band, his
candles. The light disclosed a cavern with muddy walls dripping above them, and
to their right, an inky pool of water. The air was all aflutter with the bats
they had startled from their pendant slumbers, lizards scuttled away in all
directions, and a fish flopped in the pool, with a splash that sounded out of
all proportion to its exciting cause. Ted grinned as he saw Ace first pinch
himself to see if he were dreaming, then slowly feel his joints to make sure
none were seriously damaged.</p>

<p>The fall had rather jolted his nerves, but otherwise he was unhurt, as was
his chum. But how to return the way they had come they could not see, for the
walls were too slippery to climb, there was not a spear of anything movable in
sight on which they might gain a foot-hold, and when Ted tried it from Ace&#8217;s
shoulders, the rim of the well was too slippery with mud for him to gain a
hand-hold.</p>

<p>The bats, blind from their lightless lives, <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144'></a>144</span>bumped against them
and added the final touch of weirdness by their gnome-like faces.</p>

<p>With the uncanny feeling that they ought to whisper, the shaking boys started
to explore the cavern, which they found led off in three directions. It must be
on the same level they had left when they said good-by to Radcliffe, but in
their panic they were completely turned around, and they had not explored for
ten minutes before they were so confused that they could not even have found
their way back to the cavern of the pool.</p>

<p>Now Ted had been lost before. He knew the panic feeling, the sudden sense of
utter and helpless isolation, the absurd fearfulness, almost the temporary
insanity of it. His scalp prickled,&mdash;as did Ace&#8217;s,&mdash;and for a little while his
wits seemed befogged. Then he remembered that bed-rock advice Long Lester had
once given him. When you don&#8217;t know which way to go, sit down and don&#8217;t move one
step for half an hour. And try to think out the way you got there, or some plan
of campaign for finding yourself again.</p>

<p>Ted had once been lost in the chaparral,&mdash;a <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145'></a>145</span>thorny tangle of low
growths that reached higher than his head. When he first discovered he was off
the trail, he wandered about as in a mystic maze, till a shred of his own
gingham shirt, (caught on a stub of manzanita), told him he had circled.</p>

<p>He had had to spend the night there, but in the end he had stumbled upon the
trail again, not ten feet from where he lost it.</p>

<p>As Long Lester afterwards pointed out, had he but blazed his trail from the
very first step, he could at least have back-tracked. Or better, if he had with
his jack-knife made a blaze sufficiently high on some stunted tree to have seen
it and come back to it, he might have circled, and in ever widening circles
would surely, in time, have found the trail.</p>

<p>Or, again, he might have&mdash;had he known&mdash;at least hacked a straight course by
the stars, (always provided that he knew in which direction lay the way
out).</p>

<p>&#8220;Ace,&#8221; he managed to steady his voice when they had been seated on a dry
ledge for some little time, &#8220;your knowledge of cave formations might help us
to find the way out of here. <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146'></a>146</span>Gee! If this was only in the woods, or
even on some mountain side above the clouds! But it&#8217;s up to you now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Ace began, &#8220;the map of the typical cave, say like Mammoth,
wiggles around a little like a river with its tributaries, though nothing like
so regularly, with here and there a wider place, and<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here and there,&#8221; contributed his chum, &#8220;a well to a lower
level.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. You see, the water that wears a cave out of the softer layers of rock
seeps in along the fissures of the surface rock, and at first they make
subterranean rivers. Where you find these big springs in the hillsides, they may
be the outlets of these underground waterways.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I get that, all right,&#8221; said Ted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then, sometimes these Stygian streams<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep it up, Professor!&#8221; Ted clapped him on the shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh!&mdash;These rivers wear away the soft limestone layer,&mdash;if it is this kind
of a cave,&mdash;&#8217;till they come to the harder sandstone. Then the first chance they
find to get through the sandstone,&mdash;perhaps through a crack made by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147'></a>147</span>an earthquake or something,&mdash;they go down and wear away a deeper
level. Mammoth Cave is on five levels. That leaves the upper galleries dry. Now
the one we were on was dry except for the moisture that is always seeping into a
cave, but I suspect now we&#8217;re on a level with the river, it&#8217;s so muddy, and
we&#8217;ll find it somewhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then we&#8217;ll find it somewhere!&#8221; brightened Ted. &#8220;And we can follow it.
That&#8217;s the plan of action!&#8221; and he jumped to his feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll follow it if we can. Thunder! I wish we had a boat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So long as you&#8217;re wishing, why don&#8217;t you wish for a fat steak with
onions?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It has been some time since we ate.&#8221; Ace tightened his belt. &#8220;Must be
getting late in the day! Let&#8217;s run!&#8221; And run they did, till they began
slipping on a muddy slope.</p>

<p>They had to place each foot with care now, and their progress was slow. At
the same time their candles were nearly gone. &#8220;Now let&#8217;s put out all but
one,&#8221; suggested Ted. &#8220;Just burn one at a time. What <i>would</i> we do
without any light?&#8221; But Ace did not know the answer.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148'></a>148</span>What of Pedro, meantime? At that particular instant he had just
tried to make his get-away, with the result that three drawn daggers were being
flourished threateningly and most unhealthily near his heart. He had overheard
enough evidence to convict all three of the Mexicans, thanks to his knowledge of
the parent language, but as the desperadoes pushed farther and farther into the
labyrinth, he gathered that they would come out a good safe distance from where
they had entered,&mdash;probably on the other side of the ridge. Had he known the
Ranger&#8217;s whereabouts at that precise moment, he would have felt very
differently.</p>

<p>Radcliffe, meantime, was staring into the dark recess of the cavern, but all
he could see was the two shining eyes of whatever occupant was there. Was it
bear or cougar? For both, he knew, took refuge in caves. The largeness of the
eyes inclined him to the belief that it was a California mountain lion, and such
it was part of his work to exterminate,&mdash;though the state also hires an official
lion hunter.</p>

<p>That the great cats are cowards he well knew. But this one was cornered, and
might prove no mean antagonist. With revolver cocked in <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149'></a>149</span>his right
hand, his lamp in the other, he advanced toward those two shining fires. A faint
scratching along the rocky floor warned him that the animal was gathering for a
spring. He was still rather far for a revolver shot, but he aimed straight
between the eyes. His shot reverberated with a thousand echoes. The sounds,
ear-splitting in the smoke-filled gloom,&mdash;thundered like a thousand siege guns,
it seemed to Radcliffe, stalactites tumbled about his ears like crockery, and
more appalling than all the rest was the weird, almost human scream of the
wounded animal, which likewise reëchoed for several minutes. The unwitting cause
of all this turmoil was in a cold perspiration when things finally quieted down.
But the puma, (for such it proved to be), lay dead at his feet.</p>

<p>The three Mexicans likewise heard the racket, for they, as it happened, were
not far away. The Ranger had very nearly trailed them. With rolling eyes and
hands that mechanically traced the sign of the cross, they listened, while the
thunders died away.</p>

<p>Pedro, though his nerves were more than a little shaken, was quick to seize
his opportunity. Slipping like an eel through a narrow opening
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150'></a>150</span>between two columns, where the dripstone had all but closed the way
into another chamber, he would have escaped observation entirely had it not been
for his betraying torch-light.</p>

<p>Sanchez darted after him. But remember, Sanchez was at least a hundred
pounds heavier than even well-fed Pedro. The result might have been expected. He
stuck mid-way! And there he dangled his fat legs in an endeavor to free himself,
while Pedro doubled with laughter and the other Mexicans stared, too amazed to
move.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pull, can&#8217;t you, pull!&#8221; was Pedro&#8217;s expurgated version of Sanchez&#8217;s
reiterated discourse with his followers. And when no one came to his rescue, he
nearly burst a blood vessel in his helpless wrath.</p>

<p>Pedro, feeling safe from pursuit, with such a plug in the only approach to
his sanctuary, now for the first time disclosed his knowledge of Mexican.
Sanchez&#8217;s astonishment was as huge as his attitude was undignified, and if words
could have seared, Pedro would have been well scorched. But the boy only told
him of an item he had read in the paper, where a fat man got stuck in a cave and
had to fast for three days <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151'></a>151</span>before his girth had diminished
sufficiently that he could be extricated.</p>

<p>With that, Pedro bade them a fond farewell, and departed along a labyrinthian
way they could not follow. That some one was on their trail he suspected from
the revolver shot, and the fire bugs would be nicely trapped.</p>

<p>Now the Ranger reasoned that the lion&#8217;s den would not be far from the outer
world, and in that he was right, as he proved by following it to its end. The
last lap of the way he had to wriggle along on hands and knees, but he could see
the glow of the setting sun in a circle of light at the end, and in a very few
minutes he had poked his head and shoulders beneath an overhanging bowlder on a
rock ledge. It was the Southern slope of the spur, and after a little
reconnoitering he discovered that it was the selfsame spur on which
fire-fighting headquarters had been established. The cave, then, pierced clear
through the ridge, and he had been exactly all day in following its
windings.</p>

<p>Hiking wearily up the slope to the ridge, he could see the glow of the
cook-fire perhaps a mile away, while down in the canyon on the other side the
fire still glowed in red embers <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152'></a>152</span>where it continued to devour the
blackened tree trunks, though it was under far better control than it had been
the day before.</p>

<p>Rosa&#8217;s solicitude at his haggard face and tattered, mud stained clothing
restored him wonderfully. (After all, there were compensations in the scheme of
things.)</p>

<p>&#8220;We were just about to start a search party in there,&#8221; said Norris. &#8220;I
would have before, if it hadn&#8217;t been for the fire. But where are the boys?&#8221;
He paled in alarm.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; Radcliffe dragged from white lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; gasped Rosa, her eyes filling with tears which she promptly hid by
turning her back.</p>

<p>Without a word Long Lester gathered up the paraphernalia the Ranger now saw
he had stacked and ready on the ground, and fitted it into a back-pack. There
was food, rope, and candles, another tube of carbide for Radcliffe&#8217;s lamp, a box
of matches in a tight lidded tin, and even a short length of rustic ladder made
for the occasion.</p>

<p>Norris shouldered part of it as by previous agreement.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153'></a>153</span>Radcliffe explained the diagram he tore from his note-book,
marking a black cross at the point where he had left the boys.</p>

<p>&#8220;I dunno,&#8221; said the old prospector, &#8220;but what we might as well go in
one way as another. I reckon we can folly this yere map backwards as well as
forrud, and we&#8217;ll just hike down and go in the way you kem out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a go,&#8221; agreed Norris, striding after him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; yelled the Ranger after them. &#8220;Come back! I&#8217;ll deputize you
both. Here, Norris,&#8221; and he gave the younger man his revolver and cartridge
belt, with his official pronouncement.</p>

<p>&#8220;I swan!&#8221; said Long Lester. &#8220;Here I were a-thinkin&#8217; so much about them
boys I clean forgot the Mexicans,&#8221; and he slung his rifle atop his pack.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154'></a>154</span>
<p class='cln0'>CHAPTER VIII</p>
<p class='cln1'>THE SNOW-SLIDE</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad they got in a few hours&#8217; sleep this noon,&#8221; solicitized Rosa,
placing homemade bread and coffee before the Ranger, then dipping up a bowl of
soup. She looked fagged to death herself, and Radcliffe made her promise to roll
up in a blanket on a browse bed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, if only it would rain!&#8221; she sighed, &#8220;and put out the
fire!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure wish it would!&#8221; he agreed. &#8220;Haven&#8217;t had such a big one in
years.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The DeHaviland was back with more supplies,&#8221; one of the men
reported.</p>

<p>&#8220;It sure takes tons of grub to keep these firemen stoked,&#8221; sighed Rosa
drowsily from her blankets. &#8220;But they work like lumbermen, and I&#8217;d give every
last man here a medal if I could.&#8221;</p>

<p>Norris and Long Lester skirted the South slope its whole length without
finding the cave <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155'></a>155</span>mouth from which Norris had exited. But by now it
was dark, and the task doubly difficult. &#8220;If it wasn&#8217;t for them boys being most
likely just plumb panicky from being lost,&#8221; said the old man, &#8220;I&#8217;d call it
sense to camp for the night. Once it&#8217;s sun-up, we&#8217;ll find the place easy
enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Norris was too uneasy to leave any stone unturned. What might not have
happened in the hours since he had last seen his charges! His imagination, given
free rein, pictured everything from murder to raving mania.</p>

<p>As they neared the head of the gulch, they could see, on the side of the main
ridge that towered above them, patches of snow that gleamed white in the
star-light. The canyon here headed sharply to the left.</p>

<p>The side they were on, the short side of the turn, was becoming impassable
with rough bowlders and tangling underbrush.</p>

<p>Of a sudden a low rumbling sounded faintly from seemingly beneath their feet.
The ground wavered dizzily. Trees swayed, rocks started rolling down the canyon
side, and the very bowlder they were on tilted till they had to make a quick
leap for it. It was just one of the slight <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156'></a>156</span>earthquake shocks to
which all Californians are accustomed. But never before had either Norris or
Long Lester been on such dangerous footing when one happened.</p>

<p>Quick as thought, the old man went leaping up over the bowlders, yelling
frantically to Norris to follow him. The geologist knew in a theoretical way
what to do when a snow-slide threatened, and with that lightning speed with
which our minds work in an emergency he had seen that the shock of the &#8217;quake
would precipitate snow-slides, and that they were directly in the path of
one.</p>

<p>He knew theoretically,&mdash;as the old prospector knew from observation of
several tragedies,&mdash;that the river of snow and rock-slide would flood down
canyon till it came to a turn, then hurtle off in fine spray&mdash;on the side of the
curve! (It all happened in an instant.) Their one salvation lay in taking the
<i>short</i> side of the curve,&mdash;though the going was rougher.</p>

<p>With the roar of an express train,&mdash;whose speed it emulated,&mdash;the oncoming
slide tore down at them. Down 3,000 feet of canyon the crusted snows of what was
still spring at that <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157'></a>157</span>altitude rushed like a river at flood. The
wind of its coming swayed tall trees.</p>

<p>The two men escaped by the skin of their teeth!</p>

<p>&#8220;It shore would&#8217;a scrambled us up somethin&#8217; turrible!&#8221; the old man kept
exclaiming.</p>

<p>Next day, he knew, they would find a clean swath cut down the
mountain-side,&mdash;tall pines swept away, root and branch. He had seen many of
these scars, which in later years had become a garden of fire-weed and wild
onion, a paradise for birds and squirrels and onion loving bears.</p>

<p>He had seen steep mountains fairly striped by the paths of slides, the forest
still growing between stripes. For the steeper the slope, the swifter the slide,
as might be expected.</p>

<p>Lucky for them this had been a Southwest slope; for on the North, away from
the sun, a slide is even swifter!</p>

<p>He had seen one man buried by crossing the head of a slide which gave way
under his foot. Its roar had been heard for miles. Frost-cracked from the solid
granite, the side rock that accompanied it had been weathered from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158'></a>158</span>the peak. Thus are high mountains worn away.</p>

<p>For perhaps an hour after the near-catastrophe, the air was filled with
blinding snow,&mdash;not that from the skies, but that of the snow dust raised by the
slide.</p>

<p>The circle of the rising moon threw a silver glamor over the scene. &#8220;What
do you figure makes these &#8217;quakes, anyway?&#8221; asked Long Lester.</p>

<p>&#8220;The boys have asked that too, and I can&#8217;t give it to you all in a breath.
But I&#8217;ll give you the story before we end this trip.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the moment of the earthquake, Ace and Ted, immured on a lower level of the
cave, were following a subterranean river. They got well splashed by the waves
set up, and worse scared, but it was all over in a minute and they were only a
degree more uncomfortably damp than they had been before. Suddenly Ted gave an
exclamation. A crag of drip-rock had been shaken from the roof, and there,
imbedded in the limestone, lay the plain foot-print of&mdash;it might have been a
giant!</p>

<p>The boys stared, marveling a moment, then Ted voiced his guess. The fossil of
some giant <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159'></a>159</span>of prehistoric ages! &#8220;A fossil, all right,&#8221; Ace
agreed. &#8220;But that isn&#8217;t a human footprint, even if there had been men that
size. That was made by some animal! If we ever get out of here, let&#8217;s bring
Norris and come back with picks and find out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I can quarry this fossil out and sell it?&#8221; ventured Ted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Right-o!&#8221; with a congratulatory slap that made Ted wince.</p>

<p>But the inky stream had once more become placid, and skirting the muddy ledge
alongside, they threaded their way through arches of varying height till finally
the roof was so low that they had to go on hands and knees. Then the bank became
so narrow that Ace slipped off into the unknown depths. To his surprise, his
feet touched bottom. Moreover, the water was not so cold as he had imagined. (It
was about the same temperature as the air).</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on in, the water&#8217;s fine!&#8221; he encouraged Ted. &#8220;Do you know, we
could swim this if we had to, and don&#8217;t you think it must lead out?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stands to reason. But how about our candles?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160'></a>160</span>&#8220;Hold &#8217;em in your teeth. Haven&#8217;t you ever seen any one smoke a
cigarette when he was in swimming? It&#8217;s a stunt, but<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ever tried it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure. Have you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221; And the deepening water soon proved that he could not keep his
candle going. But Ace managed it for a few strokes. Then they had to swim in
darkness. An increasing roar told them that they were nearing white water,
possibly the outlet, and just as the current from a branch stream would have
caught them, they felt an overhanging ledge and scrambled up on it, Ace lending
a hand to his less proficient chum.</p>

<p>From the far end of the tunnel shone a faint glow, as through a sheet of
water! They had reached a cave mouth.</p>

<p>Creeping cautiously along the ledge, they approached the light. From its
pallor and from the roaring of the rapids they at first thought they were behind
a waterfall. But a closer approach showed them that it shone through leaves of
plants that grew just outside, where they over-arched the escaping stream
(gooseberries, they later found, and other vines <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161'></a>161</span>that completely
hid the exit of the stream).</p>

<p>It was a ticklish proposition getting out along the rock ledge, which
narrowed to a mere rough crack into which they could dig the sides of their
soles. But by holding hands and clinging with all their might, while they
propitiated the law of gravity by leaning their weight against the wall, they
slowly scaled a way above the churning stream, and so to where they could cling
to the thorny bushes.</p>

<p>It was night. The light had been the moon shining straight into the cave
mouth. But where they were, on what side of the ridge, they could not tell.</p>

<p>They were safe, though! Saved from the blind horror of being lost in the
cave! But wet and chilled to the marrow now in the night wind that blew down
canyon, famished, footsore, and aching for sleep. Still how wonderfully fresh
and perfumed everything smelled after the cave.</p>

<p>&#8220;Got any matches in your waterproof match box?&#8221; asked Ted with
chattering teeth, throwing himself flat on the up side of a rock that would keep
him from rolling. &#8220;Why, this is funny!&#8221; for there was no sign of the stream
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162'></a>162</span>a few yards beyond the cave mouth. They were at the head of some
former rock slide, and the stream simply disappeared, percolating underneath it
to its destination, (wherever that might be).</p>

<p>But an exclamation from Ace caused him to look in the direction of his
pointing arm. In the canyon below them a bon-fire burst into bloom. &#8220;The
folks?&#8221; cried Ace joyously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe the Mexicans,&#8221; Ted restrained him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s slip up on them and find out,&#8221; urged the other. &#8220;Thunder!
Wouldn&#8217;t it be great if it was our bunch?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All the same, we gotta act just as if it was the Mexicans, till we know
for sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve sure got a good fire,&#8221; Ace shivered. &#8220;Let&#8217;s hurry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, maybe it&#8217;s Radcliffe come clear through the cave on a higher
level, and maybe he&#8217;s got the Mexicans.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And Pedro?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And Pedro!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure, who else could it be?&#8221; they cheered each other.</p>

<p>But it was neither.</p>

<p class='cln1'>TED&#8217;S FOSSIL DINOSAUR</p>
</div>

<p>An hour later two famished and exhausted boys were peering at the huge
bon-fire by which Norris and Long Lester had decided to camp till dawn.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, durn yer hide, I&#8217;m that glad to see you I&#8217;ve a notion to wallop
you,&#8221; the old guide welcomed them. &#8220;But I&#8217;m not a-goin&#8217; to ask you a single
word till you&#8217;ve et,&#8221; and he proceeded to build up a brighter fire. &#8220;Peel
off them duds, and roll up here in our blankets whilst we dry things for
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The bedraggled boys allowed Norris to help them out of their heavy,
water-soaked clothing, for their hike down the mountainside in the night wind
had fairly stiffened their joints. First Long Lester administered a quart apiece
of scalding tea, then insisted that, fagged as they were, they bathe their feet.
&#8220;A camper is <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164'></a>164</span>as good as his feet,&#8221; and Pedro had yet to be
located.</p>

<p>It was decided that, as they were all of them worn out, and Pedro, wherever
he was, would likely sleep himself when night came, they would wait till dawn to
search for him and the Mexicans. While it was a question as to whether they were
still in the cave, it seemed best to search there first.</p>

<p>At the moment of the earthquake, Pedro had been crawling through a narrow
passageway, bed of some former watercourse, whose walls dripped black in the
glow of his dying torch. Then came a crash before him!&mdash;A chunk of rock had
fallen from the roof into the passageway. When the alarming swaying motion and
the thunder of the bowlder&#8217;s fall had subsided, and he had relighted the torch,
(which had been extinguished), he found his forward progress effectually
blocked. Behind were the Mexicans,&mdash;Sanchez possibly still plugging the opening
into the passageway. He was a prisoner! He was entombed!</p>

<p>At first, utter panic possessed him. In like situation, those of weak, nervous
timbre have <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165'></a>165</span>been known to go insane. Then he got a grip on himself
and reasoned that Norris and the rest would not leave him to his fate. They
would never give him up till they had searched the cave thoroughly, and had he
not left his bandanna at one turn, his handkerchief at another, and the end of a
freshly charred torch at a third? Besides, (he smiled grimly), if his own party
did not find him, the Mexicans might. Or if they captured the Mexicans, they
would wring from them a confession of his near whereabouts. (This time he
laughed outright at thought of Sanchez the Stout still dangling his helpless
legs when the Ranger found him. The sound echoed and reëchoed weirdly.)</p>

<p>This experience had done much for Pedro&#8217;s untried courage. For after all, is
it not the unknown that terrifies us rather than the actual calamity to be
faced? Another thing that helped the Spanish boy to be reasonably
philosophical,&mdash;probably the biggest factor, after all,&mdash;was Nature&#8217;s medicine,
his extreme physical fatigue. Thrusting his hat through a narrow crevice so that
it would be seen and recognized by any one coming that way, he stretched himself
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166'></a>166</span>out flat on his back on a bit of smooth, dry rock, thriftily
extinguished the remaining bit of torch, and was instantly asleep.</p>

<p>He awoke, he knew not how much later,&mdash;but he felt refreshed,&mdash;to hear the
sound of voices echoing and reëchoing faintly, far down the passageway. Fumbling
frantically for a match, he yelled for help with all the power of his trained
voice. (And the sound echoed back and forth.) At first Norris and the boys could
not tell from which direction it came. Then Long Lester, who was in advance, saw
the hat, and it but remained to remove the bowlder.</p>

<p>Now it was that they had use for their ingenuity, for their combined efforts
did not suffice to budge the fallen rock. The cavern in which Pedro had become
immured was off a lateral passageway leading,&mdash;if he had taken the turn to the
right instead of the one to the left,&mdash;to the very cave mouth by which the
rescue party had reëntered; for Long Lester had found, not far from the waterway
through which the two boys had come,&mdash;but on a higher level,&mdash;some scratches on
the rocks and a heel print in the scanty soil that told the old mountaineer as
plain as words that that was the way <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167'></a>167</span>Radcliffe had come. Every
heel in the party was different, one having Hungarian hob-nails set in a
semi-circle, another a solid design in the same nails, a third the larger hobs,
a fourth none. He knew the differences in size and the ones that were worn
deeper on the inside of the foot. To him a footprint was as good as a signature,
and better, for like an Indian, a &#8220;hill billy&#8221; can often read how fast you
were going from a group of two or three foot-prints, how tired you were, and
much besides. This knowledge had served them in good stead. He now hurried back
to the cave mouth with Ace, found a down log that would serve as a lever, and
they pried away the bowlder that kept Pedro a prisoner.</p>

<p>Sign of the Mexicans they could not find, save that Sanchez had been removed
from the crevice of the stalactites, (at least he was no longer there), but
whether he had had to fast or not, they could not tell. The Mexicans evidently
knew the cave and they had been near the southern end of it. Though Long Lester
could find no trace of their footprints at either of the exits they knew, there
were doubtless others, and it seemed the wisest course now to look for them
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168'></a>168</span>outside. For the boys were still unwilling to give up the
chase.</p>

<p>Reporting back to Radcliffe, they learned, to their amazement, that the pack
burros the Mexicans had left near the northern cave mouth had disappeared, but
where, they could not tell from any sign left on the charred ground outside.</p>

<p>The Ranger would start a search for them in the DeHaviland, once the fire was
under better control. The Forest Service finds its air service as useful in
keeping track of law breakers as of fires. It would be an extraordinary thing if
the careless camper should escape detection, for the air men can spy them out as
easily as anything. But the fire still ate angrily through the timber, and would
spread in all directions if left to itself. Fire fighting is sometimes a matter
of weeks.</p>

<p>It was a dry summer, and all up and down the Sierras, the Rangers were kept
busy fighting the fires that would break out from one cause or another. The
Service &#8217;planes were all busy.</p>

<p>The five campers were back at fire-fighting headquarters,&mdash;and Norris
too,&mdash;when Ace had an idea. He and Ted would go in search of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169'></a>169</span>Mexicans in his little Spanish &#8217;plane. Would Radcliffe let them off
the fire-fighting? He would, though he could not give official sanction to their
plan. It was enough. The two boys were off before he could change his mind,&mdash;to
Norris&#8217;s slight uneasiness and Pedro&#8217;s envy. (But Pedro was subject to altitude
sickness.)</p>

<p>Sometime, Norris had promised Ted, they would go back into the cave and look
for his fossil. But that could wait.</p>

<p>All that afternoon the two boys curveted over the surrounding
scenery,&mdash;careful to keep their distance from the whirlwind of fire-heated air,
for they were flying low. The most minute search failed to reveal the fire
setters, but Ace only set his jaw the more determinedly.</p>

<p>They returned to sleep twelve hours at a stretch. Aviation is the best cure
yet for insomnia, and neither Ace nor Ted had ever been troubled with that
malady. The next day they flew farther, carrying with them an emergency camp
kit. They landed about every two hours, rested awhile, and finally went into
camp about four in the afternoon, intending to take a look in the night to see
if the fugitives would betray themselves by a bon-fire. They camped in a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170'></a>170</span>meadow where they had seen something like smoke arising. This
proved to be steam from a hot spring, and they thought with longing how fine
their chilled bones would feel in a good hot bath. But the spring water came too
hot. (If they had had eggs, they could have cooked them in it.)</p>

<p>Then it occurred to them to dig a little trench, line it with stones, and
carry the spring water by the folding canvas pailful to fill it. It would
quickly cool to the right temperature. The scheme worked wonderfully.</p>

<p>The water had a strong mineral taste, not altogether agreeable, but its
effect on aching bones was wonderful. A flint arrowhead buried in the soil they
excavated told its tale of Indians, who must have valued the spring and fought
for its possession against covetous tribes.</p>

<p>&#8220;What makes these hot springs, anyway?&#8221; asked Ted. &#8220;Have you had that
yet in your geology?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but you&#8217;ll understand better when Norris tells us the story he&#8217;s
promised about the formation of the earth. I&#8217;m no professor.&#8221; And he turned
a former laugh on Ted. &#8220;Tell <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171'></a>171</span>you what, Old Top, once we get these
fire bugs located for our Uncle Sammy, what say we fly up and have a look at
Lassen volcano before I send the &#8217;plane back?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bully! I&#8217;d like to fly over a glacier, too, and see what it looks like.
Can you go that high?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;guess so. Never tried it! We will, though!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee! Wouldn&#8217;t this be a great way to teach geography&mdash;from an
aeroplane!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure would!&mdash;Great way to go camping, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;S right, only&mdash;it would be if there was just the two of us,&#8221; sighed
Ted ungrammatically. &#8220;Could you carry enough grub?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We could get fresh supplies every few days, from some ranch.&#8221;</p>

<p>The next day they went back for the rest of the party and showed them Ted&#8217;s
fossil, entering the cave the way Radcliffe had left it. Norris had spent one
summer with fossil hunters in the dry gullies of the Southern end of California,
he told them, where through scorching days and thirsty nights they had searched
for any bit of bone that might lie amid the shale or <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172'></a>172</span>imbedded in
strata the edges of which might be seen on the face of a sun-baked bluff. The
summer before, a group of geology men from a rival University had actually
camped within a hundred yards of what was later discovered to be a deposit of
rare fossils. It was therefore with heightened satisfaction that their
reconnaissance had resulted in the discovery and excavation, bone by bone, of
the complete skeleton of several most interesting prehistoric monsters that had
lain all these ages embedded in the shale.</p>

<p>One bone four feet long, he told them, and weighing several hundred pounds,
had been found in fragments in the shale, but it had been fitted together again,
done up in plaster bandages and braced with splints, quite as a surgeon treats a
broken leg. Another, found embedded in solid rock, had to be shipped in the
rock, each piece being numbered as it was removed from the cliff as an aid to
fitting it together again. Then with hammer and chisel the delicate feat of
cutting away the rock and leaving the bone exposed was slowly and painstakingly
accomplished. Thus have the bones buried before <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173'></a>173</span>ever man trod the
earth been made to tell their story. Often it takes more than a single specimen
to reconstruct for the scientist the whole of the creature, but relics of fully
thirty Triceratops have been discovered in different parts of the world, and
where one skull has a broken nose, another shows it intact, and so on through
its entire anatomy.</p>

<p>Its habits may in part be reasoned out, as for instance, if its hind legs are
disproportionately long, it likely walked erect at least sometimes.</p>

<p>&#8220;That, as it happens, was not the case with Triceratops,&#8221; he added.
&#8220;There was only a slight difference between his fore and hind legs.
Triceratops had teeth made for browsing, not for rending flesh; his single claw,
round and blunt, does not indicate any pugnacious tendency on his part, and the
solidity of his bones are found to-day in either a very sluggish animal or a
partially aquatic one. The shape and rapid taper of the tail vertebræ indicates
a rather short tail, round rather than flat,&mdash;ill adapted for swimming,&mdash;and so
following through the list, till we have a Triceratops elephantine in general
build, though more like a <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174'></a>174</span>rhinoceros in face with a horn over his
nose and two over his eyes, a horn-supported neck ruff, and a generally sluggish
mode of life.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the coal fields complete imprints of Ichthyosauria have been found,
doubtless due to the carbonization of the animal matter. And impressions have
been left in stone of the very feathers worn by some of the now fossilized
creatures.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was by comparison of fossil remains that the well known evolution of the
horse from a little fellow the size of a fox was learned. Ted often thought of
that three-toed Miocene horse, and the giant monsters of his time,&mdash;of the
upthrust of the Rocky Mountains, cutting off the moist sea breeze from the
marshy country to the Eastward and making desert of it. This made life too hard
for the heavy, slow-witted creatures, and they failed to survive the change. But
the nimble footed little horse trotted long distances with ease, to find food
and water.</p>

<p>Norris convulsed them by describing the creature on which he declared the
aeroplane was modeled,&mdash;the pteranodon, that giant lizard, largest of flying
creatures even in Mesozoic age, whose bat-like wings reached 20 feet from tip
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175'></a>175</span>to tip,&mdash;as the fossil skeletons plainly prove.</p>

<p>This interesting specimen was a link in the chain between the birds of to-day
and their ancestral archeopteryx, no larger than a crow whose front legs
metamorphosed to short wings, whose skeletons have been found perfectly
preserved in the limestone.</p>

<p>Ted was frantic for fear they would not find the place again, then could
hardly wait to hear the Geological Survey man&#8217;s pronouncement on his find.
Norris chipped and chipped, with knife and hammer, till he had uncovered the
impress of a great, membranous wing.</p>

<p>It was a fossil dinosaur,&mdash;a pterodactyl!</p>

<p>Ted&#8217;s college education was secure!</p>

<p class='cln0'>CHAPTER X</p>
<p class='cln1'>HOW THE EARTH WAS MADE</p>
</div>

<p>Ted&#8217;s fossil would have to wait to be exhumed. In fact, Norris told him, he
could sell it as it stood, and let the purchaser do the work. Then it occurred
to him to wonder if Ted would not have first to take up a claim,&mdash;for it was
Government land. Anyway, he would see to it that the boy was rewarded for his
find.</p>

<p>The fire now being extinguished, Radcliffe had flown to other battle lines,
first taking Rosa&mdash;as she insisted&mdash;back to her fire outlook. The plan was for
the two boys to keep on hunting for the Mexicans, (as the harried Ranger now
counted on their doing), joining the rest of the camping party every night, at
points they would agree upon. But first, Ace had made a flight to Fresno for
supplies and to start his pilot home by train. He then carried them one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177'></a>177</span>at a time to where the burros had been left,&mdash;and where the lazy
rascals still browsed on the rich mountain meadows.</p>

<p>For a day or two, all the boys could talk, think or dream about was the
adventures they had just been through. But at last they had relieved their minds
to some extent, and one evening around the fire, Norris gave them his long
promised explanation of some of the natural wonders they had seen.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have already told you,&#8221; began Norris, &#8220;how the earth probably
originated. That much the astronomer has given us. And before the geologist can
begin to interpret the evolution of our earth, he has to know what scientists
have established in the fields of chemistry, mechanics and geodesy,&mdash;the study
of the curvature and elevation of the earth&#8217;s surface. He then proceeds to
theorize, hand in hand with the paleontologist, or student of ancient life. The
newest theory is in line with what I learned in 1917 at Yale.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all theory, then?&#8221; asked Ted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just as all sciences are, to some extent. Did I tell you that when our
planetary system was disrupted from the sun, it was less than a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178'></a>178</span>hundredth part of the parent body? And our earth is a good deal
less than a millionth of the size of our sun, and our sun is among the smaller
of the stars of the firmament.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Phew!&#8221; whistled Long Lester, round eyed, while Ted and Pedro sat
motionless.</p>

<p>&#8220;Picture the earth and moon, revolving about the sun, gathering by force of
their own gravity-pull the tiny planetesimals nearest them, these bodies hurling
themselves into the earth mass at the rate of perhaps ten miles a
second!<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It shore must have het things up some,&#8221; said Long Lester.</p>

<p>&#8220;It did! Literally melted the rocks. On top of that, this original earth
mass, composed of molten rock and gases and water vapor, was condensing.
Probably by the time it had engulfed all the stray planetesimals it could, it
was anywhere from 200 to 400 times as large as it is now. It has been shrinking
ever since.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it still shrinking?&#8221; gasped the old prospector.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure thing! But not so fast that you will ever know the difference in
<i>your</i> lifetime. It <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179'></a>179</span>only shrinks at times; then the earth&#8217;s
surface wrinkles into mountain ranges.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How many times has that been, sixteen?&#8221; suggested Ace.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll come to that. As I was going to say, while the earth was so hot, it
kept boiling, as it were, inside, and the molten matter kept breaking through
the cold outer shell in volcanoes, as the heat rose to the surface.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thet sure must have been hell,&#8221; laughed the old man.</p>

<p>&#8220;As the cold crust was churned into the hot interior, of course it melted
and expanded, and that caused more volcanoes, and so on in a vicious circle,
till finally, by the end of the Formative Era, so called, the rock that
contained more heavy minerals sank to the lower levels, while the lighter ones
rose as granite.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee!&#8221; said Ted, &#8220;I&#8217;d have called granite heavy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not so heavy as the specimens of basic rock we&#8217;ll find. Well, in this
Formative Era our atmosphere, and the hydrosphere or oceanic areas were being
formed, along with the granite continents. But while we are on the subject, I
hope you boys will some day see The Valley <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180'></a>180</span>of Ten Thousand Smokes,
in Alaska, where the earth is still boiling so close to the surface that you
have to watch your step or you&#8217;ll break through into<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Hot Place?&#8221; laughed Pedro.</p>

<p>&#8220;Literally, yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, tell us about that!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Some time!&mdash;The interior of the earth is still hot, but the rock crust
allows very little of it to rise to the surface. After the Formative Era came
the Archeozoic Era, when life began in the form of am&oelig;bas or some simple form
of protoplasm. For with the formation of the gases of the earth mass into an
envelope of air, to moderate the sun&#8217;s warmth by day and retain some of it by
night,&mdash;life became possible.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But where did those first creatures come from?&#8221; Ted could not restrain
himself from asking.</p>

<p>&#8220;According to one theory, the first germs of life flew here from some other
planet, and not necessarily one of those revolving around our own sun, for space
is full of suns and planetary systems. But that theory can neither be proved nor
disproved. When I was a student, Osborn&#8217;s theory was the latest. That was in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181'></a>181</span> 1916. Without going into it too deeply, it had to do with the
electric energy of the chemical elements that compose protoplasm, and these
always had been latent in the earth mass.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then they must have been latent in the sun, too,&#8221; marveled Ted. &#8220;And
in other suns and their planets too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very likely,&#8221; assented the Geological Survey man. &#8220;Now of course the
ocean waters collected in the depressed areas over the heavier rock bottoms, the
basalt. You remember just after we lost the burro we were on a basalt
formation<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then that was formerly a part of the ocean floor?&#8221; asked Ted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Either that or volcanic lava.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But how did it<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just a minute. Of course land masses have gone down as well as up, but
the general trend has been decidedly upward, while the trend of the ocean floor
has been downward. At that, the shell of the earth&mdash;so to speak&mdash;is only about
150 miles thick or a fiftieth of the earth&#8217;s present diameter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I should think the oceans would be growing deeper,&#8221; ventured
Pedro.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182'></a>182</span>&#8220;Right again. When this earth reaches its old age,&mdash;speaking
in terms of centuries,&mdash;it will likely be all ocean. And there used to be far
more land, in proportion, than there is now. There was less ocean water then
because of all that is continually pouring through hot springs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course the land is slowly being washed back into the ocean. And the
higher the mountains, the steeper the stream beds, and hence the faster the
streams, and the faster they erode the high elevations, till finally all is
reduced to sea level again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then how do the mountains get rebuilt?&#8221; Pedro testified his
interest.</p>

<p>&#8220;The earth has, as I think I said before, shrunk between 200 and 400 miles
in diameter,&mdash;since the beginning,&mdash;&#8216;when the earth was unformed and void, and
darkness was upon the face of the deep.&#8217; It is still shrinking. And this
internal movement is felt on the surface in differences that generally amount to
only a few hundred feet. I can show you places over there on the East wall of
the Sierras where the mountains have been upthrust that way.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, every now and again, the interior <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183'></a>183</span>activities fairly
break the rocky earth shell or lithosphere, and whole mountain ranges are
raised. There have been at least eight such minor breaks in the earth crust in
North America alone, and each time ranges perhaps a thousand miles long, or
more, have been raised near one end of the continent or the other. In addition,
there have been major re-adjustments that thrust whole continents higher and
ocean beds lower. Geologists find evidence of at least six of these major breaks
in the earth crust,&mdash;marking the beginnings of the Archeozoic Era, when
<i>life</i> originated, the Proterozoic Era, or age of <i>invertebrates</i>, the
Paleozoic Era or age of <i>fish</i> dominance, the Mesozoic Era or age of
<i>reptile</i> dominance, the Cenozoic Era or age of <i>mammal</i> dominance,
and the present Psychozoic Era or age of <i>man</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Phew!&#8221; whistled Long Lester again. &#8220;Don&#8217;t tell me this earth used to
be all fish.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It did, though. We&#8217;ll go into that some other time. I&#8217;ll just finish
about continent building now, and then we&#8217;ll turn in. At these times when the
lands are at their highest and the oceans are smallest in breadth, (because
greatest in depth), the continents are united by <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184'></a>184</span>land-bridges such
as those we have now uniting North and South America.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And Alaska and Asia?&#8221; suggested Ted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Practically, yes. And probably, at one time, South America and
Australia. These land-bridges changed the direction of the ocean streams. You
know in the age of reptiles there was nothing to divide the Atlantic from the
Pacific. Added to that, the high mountain ranges took the moisture out of the
winds from the oceans, as the Rockies now do the Pacific trade winds, so that by
the time they reach Nevada there is no moisture left in them to form clouds and
fall in rain, and we have desert.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course the animals that lived on the earth in its flatter, more
temperate stage now have to adapt themselves to life on high, cold elevations,
or in dry, hot desert areas, or to migrate via the land-bridges to more
favorable climates. Those unable to do this perished.</p>

<p>&#8220;For instance, take the age of reptile dominance, (the Mesozoic Era), which
was in turn divided into four periods, those of dinosaurs, (the Triassic period,
a rock from which I showed you, if you remember), the Jurassic period, which
gave rise to flying reptiles, from which <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185'></a>185</span>our first birds were
derived; the Comanchean period, which gave rise to flowering plants and the
higher insects, and the Cretaceous period, when our most primitive mammal forms
evolved.</p>

<p>&#8220;At first the earth was peopled with dinosaurs and flying dragons, and the
seas by squid-like mollusks. In those days all the earth was level, swampy,
tropic and overgrown with giant tree ferns and a primitive conifer.</p>

<p>&#8220;As the high mountain ranges arose and deserts were made, these forms
gradually gave way to flowers and hardwood forests, peopled with insects and
mammals. Only the most intelligent forms survived, and the struggle itself
developed a higher degree of intelligence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What in tarnation were <i>dinosaurs</i>?&#8221; asked Long Lester.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, haven&#8217;t you ever seen pictures of them?&#8221; laughed Ace. &#8220;Picture a
giant lizard, perhaps 40 feet long<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, here,&#8221; protested the old man. &#8220;I don&#8217;t bite.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is perfectly true,&#8221; said Norris soberly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Honest Injun!&#8221; vowed Ace. &#8220;One of these fellows was a sort of cross
between a crocodile <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186'></a>186</span>and a kangaroo, what with his long hind legs
that he could walk half erect on. There were some as small as eight or ten
inches, too, and some so large that you wouldn&#8217;t have come to his knee. His big
toe was as long as your arm.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And how do you know all that?&#8221; protested the old prospector feebly.</p>

<p>&#8220;By their bones,&mdash;fossils. Why, there have been fossil bones of a dinosaur
found right in the Connecticut Valley! There was one found a hundred years ago
in Oxford, England. We have heaps of fossils of them out West here. In fact,
this part of the world used to be their stamping ground, though fossils of them
have been found as far away as New Zealand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did they eat people?&#8221; gasped Lester.</p>

<p>&#8220;There weren&#8217;t any people in those days to eat, but some of them preyed on
other animals, and some browsed on the herbage of the swamps. They didn&#8217;t have
much of any brains, the Triceratops, dinosaurs twice as heavy as elephants, that
looked like horned toads, didn&#8217;t have two pounds of brains apiece, or so we
infer from the size of their skulls. They knew just about enough to eat when
they were hungry, <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187'></a>187</span>and not enough to migrate when things got
unlivable for them, and so they perished off the face of the earth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m shore glad of that,&#8221; the old man heaved a sigh of relief. &#8220;I&#8217;d
shore hate to &#8217;ve met up with one of them fellows.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And next time I want to cast aspersions on any one&#8217;s intelligence,&#8221;
shouted Pedro, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to call him a&mdash;what was it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Triceratops,</i>&#8221; said Norris. &#8220;Some dinosaurs,&mdash;in fact, most of
them,&mdash;lived in the swamps, and had long, snakelike necks and flat, apparently
earless heads, and long tails. But Triceratops had a three-horned face, one horn
over each eye to protect it in battle and one over the nose. Of course he was
the largest animal of his time, but he probably fought rival swains for his lady
love. We have a pair of Triceratops horns in the National Museum. One is broken,
and it must have been broken during life, for the stump is healed over. There
were many other kinds of dinosaurs. If we come to any fossil remains, I&#8217;ll tell
you more about them. But,&#8221; (stifling a yawn), &#8220;I guess you fellows have had
about all you can stand for to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188'></a>188</span>The boys protested to the contrary, but Norris promised the rest
of the story their next evening together around a bon-fire.</p>

<p>In the middle of the night the boys were awakened by a terrific racket. Long
Lester was yelling for all he was worth. Every one started wide awake, and
Norris threw a handful of browse on the fire to light the scene. Then the old
man managed to articulate: &#8220;Gosh A&#8217;mighty!&mdash;I sure thought the Dinosaurs were
arter me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve been dreaming,&#8221; Norris laughed, while the boys fairly rolled
over one another in their enjoyment.</p>

<p>Ace and Ted now made two flights daily in search of the Mexicans, or the
smoke of their cook-fire.</p>

<p>Next day they came to a canyon that filled the Geological Survey man with
profound enthusiasm, for, he said, it illustrated both the last glacial period
and the last period of volcanic mountain building. First they noted that the
little mountain stream had worn its torrential way through the basalt or
volcanic rock in a narrow canyon perhaps 200 feet deep. A flow of molten basalt,
accompanied by cinders, <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189'></a>189</span>had been erupted from the 8,000 foot peak
at the upper end of the canyon, and had flowed down in a layer 200 feet thick
when it hardened. It had flowed,&mdash;as the underlying rock still showed in
places,&mdash;over a lateral moraine or rock débris left by a glacier as it flowed
down that way. And from the weathered condition of this rock débris, Norris
said, it must have been a glacier, not of the last ice age, but of the one
preceding,&mdash;for of the four glacier periods generally recognized by geologists
to-day, evidences of the last two can be seen in the Sierras.</p>

<p>What made this little canyon even more of a find, (from the point of view
of what he wanted to show the boys), was that on top of the volcanic rock lay
the deposit from another glacier, one that flowed in the last ice age, as the
condition of the rock débris plainly showed the expert.</p>

<p>The boys tucked a few rock specimens into their packs and launched an
avalanche of questions. But he made them wait till they had established all snug
for the night beside a stretch of rapids, where they could look forward to
catching trout for breakfast. Then, lighting <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190'></a>190</span>his pipe, and
stretching his feet to the bon-fire,&mdash;for the night wind swept cool upon
them,&mdash;Norris began with Ted&#8217;s question as to glaciers and volcanoes.</p>

<p>&#8220;During the times I spoke of last night, when the earth crust is breaking,
the molten rock and gases and water vapor in the interior of the planet rise in
the hearts of the mountain ranges, and often break through as active volcanoes,
pouring their lava and ash over the underlying granite, and building it still
higher.</p>

<p>&#8220;These heightened mountain ranges bring about the glacial climates. For the
snows on their cold peaks do not melt when summer comes, and consequently they
accumulate, and accumulate, till their own weight presses them down as hard as
ice,&mdash;that is, makes glaciers of them. I am going to be on the look-out for a
glacier, for you will have a good chance to see them in this region. At the same
time, during these glacial periods, the astronomer could explain how it is that
the temperature is from ten to twenty degrees colder in both winter and summer
than it is now, so that helps the ice to accumulate. Then the glacier, flowing
slowly, slowly, (a river of ice), down the mountainsides, <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191'></a>191</span>carries
with it quantities of the underlying rocks, till it reaches a lower level where
the ice melts and it becomes a river and carries those rocks and soil to the
sea. That way, the mountains are gradually worn down to sea level and the whole
cycle is ready to start over again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; said the ranch boy. &#8220;How long ago did you say the last
glacier period came?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Probably not since the time of the first men,&mdash;perhaps 30,000 years
ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And those glacial deposits you showed us to-day are 30,000 years old?&#8221;
the boy breathed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and the deposits from the glacial period before that are older
still,&mdash;a souvenir from the age of reptile dominance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then when did the other ice ages come? Did you say there were
five?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did, but only four great ones. There were two away back in the age of
invertebrates.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then has the climate been the same since the last ice age?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at all. The change is gradual, and geologists naturally conclude that
some time we will have another ice age. We&#8217;ll hope man has found a better way to
keep warm by that <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192'></a>192</span>time. Our climate, with all its ups and downs,
is little by little, through the centuries, growing colder!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And how do you know about all these ups and downs of climate?&#8221;
challenged Long Lester.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, for one thing,&mdash;we don&#8217;t have to read it all from the rocks,&mdash;there
is a plain story in the rings of growth in the Big Trees. Don&#8217;t you remember
those cut stumps, and the thousands of rings we counted, one for a year? And
some were wider than others, because in those years there had been more
rainfall.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I never!&#8221; was all the old prospector could articulate, as all
hands once more called it a day.</p>

<p>Next day Ace searched in concentric circles, but without finding a trace of
Mexicans, or, indeed, of any one.</p>

<p>The next night found the little party encamped an eight hours&#8217; hike up the
side of another glacial polished slope. The trail,&mdash;that is to say the way they
picked to go,&mdash;led first to the upper end of the canyon and over the rocks that
bordered a green-white water-fall. The wind blowing the spray in first one
direction and then another, they got well wetted, though <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193'></a>193</span>the clear
California sunshine soon dried them again. But the most curious part of their
climb past the falls was the rainbow that persisted in following them till they
seemed to be at the hub of a huge semicircle of opalescent tints.</p>

<p>Above, (perhaps eight hundred feet higher than their camp at the hot spring),
they came to where the river slid green and transparent over granite slopes just
bordered by a fringe of pine. The water ran deep and swift, though, and as Ted
stooped to drink, he found that, rhythmically, a larger swell, (call it a wave),
would slap him in the face, till once, blinded by the unexpected onslaught, he
all but lost his balance. It would have been inevitable, had he done so, that he
should almost instantly go hurtling over that eight hundred foot drop, whose
waters roared till the boys had to shout at each other to be heard even a few
paces away. But the water was deliciously icy, from its fountain-head in the
glacier above.</p>

<p>Wide slopes just steep enough to make climbing demand considerable
sure-footedness widened this hanging valley on either side, with no greenery
save the picturesque bits that grew <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194'></a>194</span>along the weathered cracks.
Beyond this, the canyon walls continued to rise abruptly.</p>

<p>Trailing along beside the river till it had widened out and quieted its song,
they found one of the typically open, parklike, forests of silver firs, jeweled
with occasional emerald meadows fragrant with purple lupin and gay with crimson
columbine and golden buttercups. Under foot were white violets and wee,
monkey-faced mimulus, with occasionally a rare scarlet monkey-flower.</p>

<p>They passed one of the tributaries of the river, crossed it on a log, and
paused to drink deep of its sweet fluid. They found a huge fallen log with a
mushroom growth that Pedro pronounced edible and which they found not unlike
cooked crab meat. They crossed other brooklets, paused at noon to eat a dry
lunch, and to their amazement spied a doe and her half-grown fawn in the edge of
the clearing watching them wistfully as they threw their scraps away. Pedro,
approaching softly, and casting peace offerings before him, was able to approach
to within several paces of the mother, though her young hopeful was less
trustful. Having probably never seen a biped before, both animals
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195'></a>195</span>were consumed with curiosity and comparatively unafraid. The old
prospector suggested with a wink that a little &#8220;wild mutton&#8221; would not go
amiss, the game laws being adaptable to the needs of those in extremity, but
Norris reminded him that they were no longer in extremity, and the boys voted
unanimously not to betray the trust of this wild mother.</p>

<p>Now came a stiff climb around a rocky shoulder of the mountain, and along the
cracks of the smooth rock slopes, as once more they traversed the path of an
ancient glacier. The opening here between the two folds of mountains again
disclosed their river, now smaller, but if anything even noisier, by reason of
its race over a series of cascades. They had left the silver fir belt and were
in the region of dwarfed mountain pines. They estimated that they must be about
8,000 feet high.</p>

<p>Ace joined them with still no news of the fugitive fire setters. It was
mysterious.</p>

<p>It being Ted&#8217;s and Pedro&#8217;s turn to make camp that night, they dropped the
packs under a gnarled old juniper whose trunk had been split by lightning into
seven splinters that curved out over a little hollow, making an ideal
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196'></a>196</span>shelter, with its fubsy foliage, its storm-twisted limbs making
natural seats, and a flat-topped rock a table. They had to carry pine boughs
some distance for their beds, as they did wood and water. Then they sallied
forth for a string of fish.</p>

<p>All this gave Ace, Norris and Long Lester time to climb the short remaining
distance to the top of the ridge, where they could gaze across at snow-capped
peaks on which the alpine glow of approaching sunset had spread a luscious
rose.</p>

<p>While they were reclining in quiet enjoyment around the supper fire,&mdash;the
last flutter of the breeze fanning their faces,&mdash;a tawny, catlike form suddenly
came tip-toeing out from behind an edge of rock. It was an animal possibly a
hundred pounds in weight,&mdash;the California mountain lion is not a heavy
animal,&mdash;and for all its wide, heavy looking feet it trod with lithe grace.
(Those paws, so well adapted to travel over deep snow, would enable it to seek
its prey when white winter shut down over all its hunting grounds.)</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<a id='illus-196'></a>
<img src='images/illus-196.jpg' alt='' />
<p class='c'>It was a rare treat to see a lion so close.</p>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197'></a>197</span>Now it was to all of them a rare treat to see a lion so close
to. Of all the denizens of the wild, none are so shy of human kind, in regions
where they are hunted,&mdash;none so thoroughly nocturnal. The three men fairly held
their breaths to watch.</p>

<p>First the animal leapt to a branch of a wind-beaten tree and crouched along
its limb, lying so still that, had they not seen it move, they might have
glanced squarely in that direction and never noticed. And there it lay,
sharpening its claws, cat fashion.</p>

<p>Suddenly it began narrowing its yellow eyes at what must have been a movement
behind the rock whence it had emerged. Gathering its feet for a spring, it laid
its ears back, and the great muscles rippling beneath its skin, leapt at a
second lion whose head could now be seen peering around the rock. But did they
fight? Not a bit of it! With hiss and arching back, and all claws out like the
picture of a witch cat, the young cougar challenged his playfellow, then
retreated as the other would have given him a swipe of his paw. Back to his tree
he raced, the other after him. But no sooner had he reached the vantage point of
his horizontal branch than he turned and chased the other back. This play was
repeated several times, <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198'></a>198</span>while the three men watched to the
windward, silent and motionless, and hence unseen by the near-sighted
animals.</p>

<p>A small rock had been loosened by their scramble, and as it went rolling over
the granite slope, the first cat pounced after it playfully, finally catching
the rolling stone and leaping about it as a cat does a mouse. Then he retired to
his tree.</p>

<p>Norris, reflecting that the near presence of two such animals would stampede
the burros, picked up a stone and threw it at the lion, intending, not to hit
it, but to chase it away. To the surprise of the onlookers, the huge cat pounced
on the stone as playfully as before. Ace now hurled a small rock so that it just
escaped the tawny flank, but again she pounced, as playful as a kitten, at each
missile, and it was not till the three men rose and shouted that the lion took
alarm and raced away.</p>

<p>&#8220;I declare!&#8221; exclaimed Pedro, when he heard about it, &#8220;I&#8217;d never have
believed it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was out in Devil&#8217;s Gulch one day,&#8221; remarked Long Lester, &#8220;with a
coupla dogs. It&#8217;s all granite,&mdash;hard for the dogs to get a scent,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199'></a>199</span>but there&#8217;s lots of lions there, in among the rocks. Finally,
though, they got one into a little Digger Pine. I took a shot at her, and out
she tumbled.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dead?&#8221; asked Norris.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. The dogs found her den, and dragged out three cubs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How large?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;About the size of house cats, that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I put &#8217;em into my shirt and tuk &#8217;em home. I sold &#8217;em afterwards to a
circus man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, do lions always act the way this one did to-night?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I heard tell of a boy that was out with an old three dollar Winchester 22,
and a dog that had lost a leg in a bear trap. Pretty soon he barked
&#8216;treed.&#8217; He had a lion up in a scrub oak. It came down fighting, so the boy
had to circle around trying to find a chance to shoot. Then it jumped up into a
pine tree and lay with its head over the limb looking down at him. He shot at
it, but I guess it didn&#8217;t hit, for it ran again, and by jings, it finally got
clean away!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t they ever fight?&#8221; marveled Pedro.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200'></a>200</span>&#8220;They&#8217;ll fight a dog if they come down wounded, but the big
cats are mostly cowards.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But bears are not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bears? No, nothing cowardly about them. They&#8217;re more lazy&#8217;n anything
else.&#8221;</p>

<p class='cln0'>CHAPTER XI</p>
<p class='cln1'>THE VALLEY OF TEN THOUSAND SMOKES</p>
</div>

<p>The next morning they had a good look around before deciding which way to go.
On one side pointed firs in patches on the canyon walls contrasted with the snow
in the ravines. There was a brook that divided, then reunited in white strands,
only to spread out into a smooth, glistening sheet, golden in the sunlight, to
join the green river.</p>

<p>The notches between two rounding, glacier-smoothed granite masses disclosed
distant peaks, snow-capped, their jagged ledges thrusting through the mantling
white, dazzling in the sunshine like a mirror,&mdash;now gray under a hazing sky, now
dappled under a passing shower cloud.</p>

<p>They finally decided to wind through the gap, and Pedro, Norris and Long
Lester started on with the burros, while Ace and Ted started fine-combing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202'></a>202</span>the map beneath them for the elusive Mexicans. Very probably, they
thought, they had been hiding in some of the caves that honeycombed the region,
and sooner or later they would have to reappear. Their supplies could not hold
out forever.</p>

<p>All along the Western flank of the Sierra, (as both Norris and Long Lester
were able to assure them), from the McCloud River in the North to the Kaweah,&mdash;a
distance of at least 400 miles,&mdash;stretched a belt of metamorphic limestone,
reaching up to as high as 7,000 feet, and it was fairly riddled with caves.</p>

<p>But again the day went by without success. Ace only squared his chin. Ted
offered to abdicate his observer&#8217;s seat in favor of any one of the party, but
Pedro and Long Lester preferred terra firma, and even Norris found more to
interest him in the rocks beneath their feet.</p>

<p>Once a little spiral of smoke drew them to a canyon head where they found
three fishermen with a pack train of seven horses,&mdash;but no Mexicans. They
searched Southward along the John Muir trail, returning along the Eastern
flank,&mdash;but to no purpose, so far as the fugitives were concerned.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203'></a>203</span>As no one had had time to fish, they dined on tinned corned
beef, which Ace, the cook for the day, made the mistake of salting. (After that
he had to make tea twice.)</p>

<p>&#8220;One thing I&#8217;d like fer to ask you, Mr. Norris,&#8221; said Long Lester that
night around the bon-fire, &#8220;is where does the salt in the ocean come from? I
don&#8217;t see for the life of me, from what you&#8217;ve told us<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The salt was originally in the rock of the earth&#8217;s crust,&#8221; Norris
explained with a pleased smile at the old man&#8217;s interest. &#8220;As this igneous
rock weathered with time, the rain and the streams washed it into the ocean.
Then when the sea water evaporates<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To make clouds, to make more rain?&#8221; Long Lester recited.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&mdash;the salt of course remained behind, so that the oceans have been
growing constantly saltier since the earth began. Yet even now sea water must be
nine-tenths evaporated before the sodium begins to precipitate, as we
say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So there is room for a lot more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Especially as the oceans are growing larger all the time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But doesn&#8217;t the ocean give it back to the <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204'></a>204</span>land when it leaves
these sediments along the shore?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not to any extent, speaking comparatively. But one of the interesting
things about the salt in the sea is this: Chemists and geologists estimate that,
for the amount of salt in the sea, enough of the original earth crust must have
been weathered away to have covered the continents over 6,000 feet high. And
that calculation just about fits what we believe to have happened.</p>

<p>&#8220;The United States Geological Survey gave out an official statement in 1912
that this country is annually being washed back into the ocean at the rate of
two hundred and seventy million tons of matter dissolved in the streams and five
hundred and thirteen millions of tons of matter held in suspension in the same
streams. That is to say, the oceans every year receive from the surface of the
United States seven hundred and eighty-three millions of tons of rock
materials.</p>

<p>&#8220;That means that, here in this part of the country at least, one hundred
and seventy-seven tons per square mile are being washed back each year.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee!&#8221; said Ted. &#8220;I should think, at that <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205'></a>205</span>rate, that the
continents would have been all washed away long ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, there have been, since geological history began, at least twenty
whole mountain ranges as high as the Rockies worn to sea level. Of course the
oceans have periodically flooded the margins of the continents at such times, in
long troughs where now stand our Appalachian and Rocky Mountain ranges, leaving
their deposits.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the Rockies there are coarse sediments miles deep, together with
limestone formed of the ground-up shells of marine animals of the earlier
times. Now think of this!</p>

<p>&#8220;If all that stands above sea level in the United States to-day were to be
washed into the sea, as it undoubtedly will be, in time,&mdash;(but not in our time),
the level of the oceans will rise, (just as the level of a half glass of water
rises if you drop in a handful of sand), until&mdash;it has been
estimated&mdash;everything under six hundred and fifty feet above sea level will be
inundated. That means that probably half of the continent would be under water.
It has been so in times past, and it will be again. In fact, in the age of
reptile dominance, (the Cretaceous <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206'></a>206</span>Period), when the earth was just
beginning to be peopled with birds and flying reptiles, and the first, primitive
mammals,&mdash;the Atlantic flowed straight from what is now the Gulf of Mexico,
through what is now the Rocky Mountain Region, and through the Eastern part of
Alaska, to the Arctic. That left one strip of land that reached along what is
now the Pacific Coast, clear from the Isthmus of Panama to the Aleutian Islands
and straight across to Siberia. The Northern part of the Atlantic Coast formed
another land area, broken by the fresh water bodies of America and Canada and in
one with a strip of land that extended across Greenland to Europe.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is pretty well established, in fact, that the United States has been
more or less flooded by warm, shallow marine waters at least sixteen times since
the age of fish dominance began. But not since the age of man!&#8221; he hastened
to assure the old prospector, who was beginning to look uneasy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course these flood times brought a moist, warm climate to the land
areas, and life was easy for the then existing animal forms. Then when
readjustments in the earth&#8217;s crust again <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207'></a>207</span>raised up mountain ranges
and the climate became colder and drier, the struggle for existence became more
intense, the process of evolution was stimulated, and new forms
originated.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are living in one of those periods now. The organic world is being
stimulated to develop even better bodies, endowed with even more alert
brains.</p>

<p>&#8220;Life is easiest of all for the inhabitants of the ocean. That is why they
have developed so little intelligence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that why it&#8217;s such an insult to call any one a poor fish?&#8221; grinned
Ted.</p>

<p>&#8220;An ichthyosaurus?&#8221; supplemented Ace.</p>

<p>&#8220;As has been said before,&#8221; Norris took up the thread of his talk,
&#8220;with a drier climate and soil, comes the need of developing a faster mode of
locomotion, for food no longer lies or swims everywhere about, as it did in the
ocean, and in the swamps, and tropic humidity. Food and water are scarce, and it
is the speediest animal that fulfills his needs. This speediness on his part
means that he uses up more energy, and hence needs more food, and he needs to
assimilate it faster. In other words, it means increased metabolism. This in
turn means that <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208'></a>208</span>he keeps his body at a higher temperature. He needs
it too, now, with the increased cold. This results in the development of warm
blood, by which the animal can maintain his body warmth regardless of winter
cold. If it had not been for conditions that forced certain reptiles to develop
warm-bloodedness, we would have no birds or mammals to-day, for as you doubtless
know, birds and mammals both were evolved from reptiles.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I swan!&#8221; was all the old prospector could say.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, the first mammals developed from a reptile known as the cynodont.
Many of these reptiles had long legs and could travel with the body well off the
ground. Birds originated from the same reptilian stock as did the dinosaurs.
First their hind-legs grew long so that they could run on them,&mdash;and you will
notice at the Museum how the legs of a dinosaur are joined to the body exactly
like a bird's,&mdash;then their scales gradually evolved into feathers.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is a lot more to it than I can tell you now, but after various ups
and downs, dinosaurs became extinct and Nature tried out several kinds of
warm-blooded, furry mammals, <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209'></a>209</span>some of them herbivorous and built for
speed to run away from their enemies, some of them swamp-dwelling monsters with
heavy legs and small brains, who, slow of movement, relied on horns and other
armor and sharp teeth for their defense.</p>

<p>&#8220;But there is no end to this subject. I only mean to make the point that it
was geological changes that drove the fish to land, and the land animal to
higher forms, till finally other geological changes drove man&#8217;s ancestors down
out of the trees.&#8221; The boys, no less than the old prospector, testifying
their interest in the last named operation, he continued.</p>

<p>&#8220;When the Alps, the Andes and the Himalayas arose, man&#8217;s ancestors still
lived in trees. But high mountains hold a large part of the moisture of the
atmosphere in the form of snow and ice, and at the same time the decreased
oceanic areas offer less surface for evaporation. Not only does that mean a
drier climate, but the sun&#8217;s rays pass more freely through dry air, and the days
are hotter, and the heat passing freely back through the same dry air at night,
the nights are colder. Seasons are more extreme, and ice accumulates on the
mountain <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210'></a>210</span>tops and around the polar region, precursor of a glacier
period. The aridity decreases the amount of forest, and the manlike tree dweller
had to descend to the ground to get his living. That necessitated the
development of his hind legs for speed, and that speed necessitated his assuming
a wholly erect posture. That in turn freed his hands, and he, or the man
descended from him, could defend himself by throwing stones at the huge beasts
who then peopled the earth. The cold winters necessitated the use of the skins
of beasts for clothing, and so on through the list. It was geological necessity
that drove man into his higher development.</p>

<p>&#8220;Changes of climate and environment, however, are stimulating, even to-day.
Statistics show that stormy weather actually increases people&#8217;s energy.&#8221;</p>

<p>The next day they passed a long crack in a rock slope, which Norris felt sure
had been made by an earthquake, perhaps as recent as that of 1906, to judge from
the cleanness and newness of it. The crack was no more than a foot or two in
width, but in places eight feet deep, they estimated, and along the Western
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211'></a>211</span>side of it stood a fault scarp, in this case a wall of granite
bowlders of various sizes up to four or five feet in height.</p>

<p>&#8220;This,&#8221; pronounced the geology man, &#8220;is evidently a region overlying
subterranean volcanoes, which might even yet build the range higher. I&#8217;ll bet
that kind of mountain building may still be going on around here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again and again Norris, or even Ace, had been able to point out, in the
record of the rocks, the evidences of the two glacier periods that had helped
shape the Sierra Nevada, the earlier one much larger, and enduring longer, as
shown by the moraines (or deposits) left behind. The lower end of a canyon would
be no wider than the stream that incised it, but the upper portion would have
been smoothed into grassy parks or lakelets on each tread of a giant stairway to
the summit of the range.</p>

<p>Rounded waterworn pebbles and cobblestones among a mass of angular bowlders,
left behind by glacier streams, together with an occasional striated pebble,
were &#8220;sermons in stones&#8221; to the geologist.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hey, Ted,&#8221; his chum had challenged him that day, &#8220;did you ever see a
pirate?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212'></a>212</span>&#8220;Don&#8217;t know as I did,&#8221; admitted the ranch boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll show you one. Climb in,&#8221; and he prepared to search once more
for the Mexicans.</p>

<p>&#8220;Show me one! You speak as if they kept them in museums.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This pirate will be a river. A river pirate,&mdash;I mean a pirate river! If I
could find the divide just North of Muah Mountain I&#8217;d show you where streams are
being captured this minute. Cottonwood Creek has already captured one of the
tributaries of Mulkey Creek, I hear, and diverted it into an eastward flow, and
further captures are likely to be pulled off any time. Isn&#8217;t it a
scandal?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, Ace,&#8221; protested his chum, &#8220;I&#8217;ve swallowed a lot since we
started on this trip, but I&#8217;m not so gullible as you seem to think.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here, old kid,&#8221; said Ace seriously. &#8220;It&#8217;s a fact. Along a
divide, a stream flowing one way will divert one flowing the other way into its
own channel.&#8221;</p>

<p>They found a pirate river,&mdash;but still no trace of the incendiaries. However,
that merely determined the Senator&#8217;s son the more.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213'></a>213</span>That night Norris told them the long promised tale of his
Alaskan trip.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing like the Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes has ever been seen by the
eye of man,&#8221; he declared. &#8220;If we could take all the other volcanic regions
of the world to-day and set them down side by side, they would present less of a
spectacle, except, of course, at the time of a dangerous eruption. There has
been nothing like it in the memory of man,&mdash;though geologists can read from the
rocks that such conditions must have existed in past ages. The Mt. Katmai
eruption of 1912, one of the most dangerous in history, first attracted
attention to this region, and the National Geographic Society has since sent
various expeditions to Alaska. It was that way that the Valley came to be
discovered, in 1916.</p>

<p>&#8220;I happened to be a member of the last expedition.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Honestly!&#8221; the boys exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and I tell you, boys, when I first looked through Katmai Pass, it
just looked as if the whole valley were full of smoke. Of course it was
steam.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214'></a>214</span>&#8220;Weren&#8217;t you afraid of another volcano?&#8221; asked the boys,
snuggling down ready for a real story.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, because with all those vents letting off steam, it must relieve the
pressure from below, like so many safety-valves. Two black, glassy looking lava
mountains guard the pass. The wind on the side of Observation Mountain was
blowing so hard it honestly lifted us off our feet at times, and it blew a hail
of pumice stone in our faces that literally cut the flesh. Of course we wore
goggles.</p>

<p>&#8220;Once in the valley, there were certainly all of ten thousand smokes rising
from the ground. We were simply speechless, it was such an awesome
spectacle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll bet you were!&#8221; breathed Ted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Personally, I consider it more wonderful than either the Grand Canyon or
the geysers of the Yellowstone. As far as we could see in any direction,&mdash;and
there seemed to be three arms to the valley,&mdash;the white vapor was steaming out
of the ground until it mingled with a great cloud that hung between the mountain
walls. And we later camped in places where we could keep our food in a hollow of
a glacier <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215'></a>215</span>while we boiled our breakfast in a steam hole, and the
ground was almost too warm for comfort.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Must have been an ideal camping place,&#8221; said Ace.</p>

<p>&#8220;Far from that. Too much danger of breaking through. And then of course
there wasn&#8217;t a tree or a grass blade anywhere, much less a stick of firewood.
But we sure had steam heat at night, and we cooked, in the milder of the
fumaroles.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wasn&#8217;t there a lot of gas coming up with the steam?&#8221; asked Ace.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but it didn&#8217;t taint our food any. It was an ideal steam cooker.
Farther down the valley were some vents hot enough to fry bacon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should think it would have steamed it,&#8221; said Ted.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, we found one vent where the steam came so hot that it didn&#8217;t condense
for several feet above ground; the only trouble was that the frying pan had a
tendency to go flying up in the air and the cook had to have a strong arm to
hold it down.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the picture his memory evoked, Norris <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216'></a>216</span>burst into hearty
chuckles. &#8220;As the bacon got crisp, of course it didn&#8217;t weigh so heavy, and
there always came a point where it began to fly out of the pan. Then we&#8217;d all
stand around, and it was the liveliest man that caught the most
breakfast.</p>

<p>&#8220;There was another camp convenience, too, there in Hades, as the valley has
been named.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thar, didn&#8217;t I tell you so?&#8221; triumphed Long Lester.</p>

<p>&#8220;And they named the river Lethe. A river that ran down from the melting
glaciers,&mdash;though it almost all goes up in smoke, as it were,&mdash;in steam, before
it gets out of the hot part. This river whirls along, and in places the steam
actually boils up through the ice water, or along the banks. I used to think it
was an awful pity there were no fish in that stream, because we could have
cooked them without taking them off the hook.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh!&#8221; The old prospector shook his head. &#8220;I&#8217;ve thought all along this
here was a fish story.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s gospel truth,&#8221; Norris assured him. &#8220;I mean about the valley.
I <i>said</i> there were no fish. Everything we ate, by the way, had to be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217'></a>217</span>packed in on our backs. It was no place for horses, where in places
the ground fairly shook beneath our feet, and if it were to give way, we&#8217;d find
ourselves sure enough in hot water.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It must have been almighty dangerous,&#8221; gasped Ted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, not after we learned the ropes. Sometimes we accidentally put a foot
through a thin place and steam came through. I assure you we stepped lively
then. At other times our feet sank into the soft, hot mud.</p>

<p>&#8220;By the way, there is a mountain across the head of the valley that looks
like a crouching dog, and it has been named Cerberus.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Were those geysers, those ten thousand smokes?&#8221; asked the old
prospector.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, a geyser comes after volcanic activity, while here something is still
likely to happen. A geyser begins as a column of steam and hot water, which
erupts as often as the water gets to the boiling point. It follows that the
water must accumulate in rock not so hot that it would instantly vaporize it.
But the rock underlying this valley is so hot that no water can accumulate.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218'></a>218</span>&#8220;How large are the vents through which the steam comes?&#8221;
asked Ted.</p>

<p>&#8220;All sizes down to nothing at all. There are even a few craters 100 feet
across, that have been produced by volcanic explosions. You will find these
craters, generally, along a large fissure, just the way you find the Aleutian chain
of volcanoes along a fissure in the earth&#8217;s crust several hundred miles in
length.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are fissures all along the margins of the valley, besides those in
the center, and many of these have one side standing higher than the other,
showing them to be earthquake faults,&mdash;the same sort of thing we see here in the
rocks of the Sierras. And you should hear the hissing and roaring of the steam
as it forces its way up through these fissures from the hot depths beneath.
Sometimes it looks like blue smoke, it is so full of gases, especially sulphur
dioxide, the gas that is given off by burning sulphur. So the popular notion of
Hades isn&#8217;t so far off after all, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Could you smell the sulphur fumes?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sometimes, yes,&mdash;when the other gases did not overwhelm the odor. But the
weirdest part of all is the incrustations along the borders of <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219'></a>219</span>the
vents. All colors of the rainbows&mdash;shapes as fantastic as anything in fairyland.
Lots of yellow, of course, from the sulphur,&mdash;crystals of it, some of them
neighbor to an orange tinted crystal, lying in the blue mud. It was a beautiful
color combination. Then there were green and gray alum crystals which looked
like growing lichens. There were also deep green algæ actually growing. Strange
how certain designs are used over and over again in nature! In other places the
mud is actually burned brick red, especially where the fumaroles are burnt out.
This shades to purple, and in other places to pink. But the most surprising,
perhaps, were the white vents just tinted with a delicate pink or
cream.</p>

<p>&#8220;The largest fissure of all, one lying at the foot of Mt. Mageik, is filled
with the clear green water of a melted glacier. And above, the mountain smokes
away into the clouds!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It must be a marvelous place!&#8221; said Ace. &#8220;I suppose it was regular
ice water.&#8221;</p>

<p>Norris laughed. &#8220;That is the funny part of it. It&#8217;s not. The water is
actually warm, or rather, tepid, in places, on account of the heat from
below.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220'></a>220</span>&#8220;So you had good swimming even in Alaska.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We might have had. And then I must tell you about Novarupta. That&#8217;s the
largest vent in the valley, and it is something you won&#8217;t see very many places
in the world, a new volcano. It was only formed at the time of the eruption of
1912, and it is one of the largest volcanoes in the world to-day,&mdash;with a crater
much larger than that of Vesuvius.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But Mr. Norris, do y&#8217; mind my asking,&#8221; Pedro hesitated, &#8220;but how do
you know it is a new volcano? Don&#8217;t volcanoes sometimes burst forth again after
many years of quiet?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They do, but there is where the rocks tell the story again. Instead of
bursting forth from a mountain top, through igneous rock, (left from the time
when the earth-crust was molten), this one erupted in the valley, in sandstone.
On a still day, the smoke will rise as high as ten thousand feet.&#8221;</p>

<p>Norris, then a student, had been one of the first to view Lassen Volcano
when, in 1914, it broke its slumber of 200 years. Indeed, he had had a real
adventure, as the second outburst had caught him within half a mile of the
crater <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221'></a>221</span>and he had barely escaped with his life. Of course the boys
had to hear all about it.</p>

<p>While the Sierra south of Lassen has been built more through uplift than
volcanic activity, at least since the Tertiary period, he explained, the
Cascades and indeed, the whole range to the northward through Oregon and
Washington, is a product of lava flow.</p>

<p>Happening to be about to start on a camping trip in the Feather River region
at the time of the first eruption, he and his companion had hastened immediately
to the scene of so much geological history making. The smoke and ashes that
billowed forth had been visible for fifty miles, and the accompanying earthquake
shocks had been accompanied by a downpour of rain.</p>

<p>Climbing the path of a recent snow-slide, which had cleared a narrow path in
the fifteen-foot drifts, they could smell sulphur strongly from near the South
base onward. Veering around to the East, past half a dozen cinder cones, they
finally reached a narrow ridge leading directly to, as yet unoccupied, the fire
outlook station. Clambering over crags so steep, <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222'></a>222</span>finally, that they
could not see ahead, they came to the little square building, now tattered by
the stones that had fallen through its roof, tethered to the few feet of space
available by wire cables that seemed to hold it down in the teeth of the winds.
Suddenly below them lay the bowl of the ancient crater, bordered by snow fields
now gray with ash. That the ash had not been hot they judged from the fact that
it had nowise melted the snow, but lay on its surface. From the ragged edge of
the steaming basin, yellow with sulphur, rose the oppressive fumes they had been
getting more and more strongly. How deep was this funnel to the interior of the
earth? To their amazement it appeared to be only about 80 feet deep. That, they
decided,&mdash;coupled with the fact that the ash and rocks exploded had not been
hot, but cold, must be because the sides of the crater, as they gradually caved
in, must have choked the neck of the crater with débris, which had been expelled
when the smoke and gases had been exploded. There had been no lava flow,
then!</p>

<p>They had retraced their steps to perhaps half a mile&#8217;s distance when of a
sudden the earth beneath their feet began to heave and rumble
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223'></a>223</span>thunderously. Ashes and rocks, some the size of flour sacks, some
huge bowlders, began shooting into the air,&mdash;observers at a distance assuring
them afterwards that the smoke must have risen 3,000 feet above the peak. It
grew black as midnight, the smoke stung their eyes and lungs and whiffs of
sulphur nearly overwhelmed them.</p>

<p>It was a position of deadly peril. Quick as thought, they ran, Norris
dragging his companion after him, beneath the shelter of an overhanging ledge,
where at least the rocks could not fall on them, and there they buried their
faces in the snow and waited.</p>

<p>What seemed hours was later pronounced to have been but fifteen minutes,
though with the roaring as of mighty winds, and the subterranean grumblings and
sudden inky night, the crashing of stones and thundering of rolling bowlders, it
seemed like the end of the world.</p>

<p>Norris&#8217;s companion had suffered a blow that dislocated his shoulder, but
otherwise they emerged unhurt. They afterwards found several areas on the sides
of Lassen where sulphurous gases were escaping from pools of hot mud or boiling
water. They also visited a lake that <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224'></a>224</span>had been formed at the time of
the lava flow of 200 years ago, (now a matter of legend among the Pitt River
Indians), this lava having formed a dam across a little valley which later
filled from the melting snows. The stumps of the inundated trees could still be
seen.</p>

<p>A geyser, said the Geological Survey man, is just like a volcano, only it
expels steam and boiling water from the interior. There is a line of volcanic
activity up and down the Pacific Coast, from Alaska to Central America, though
Lassen is the only active peak in California, Shasta having become quiescent
save for the hot spring that steams through the snow near its summit.</p>

<p>The North half of the range, he added, is covered with floods of glassy black
lava and dotted with extinct craters, whereas the Southern half is almost solid
granite, though there are plenty of volcanic rocks to be found among its wild
gorges. The rocks around Lassen tell a vivid story of the chain of fire
mountains that must have again and again blazed into geysers of molten rock,
till the whole smoking range was quenched beneath the ice of that last glacier
period, which through the ages has been sculpturing <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225'></a>225</span>new lake and
river beds, and grinding soil for the rebirth of the mighty forests.</p>

<p>The boys drowsed off that night to dream of fire mountains and explorations
in the nether regions.</p>

<p>The next day they planned to bi-plane up and down the John Muir trail again
and see if the Mexicans could have crossed to the Eastern side of the range.
They might have made their way through some pass, traveling after nightfall and
hiding by day, and once on the desert around Mono Lake they would be easy to
locate. For it seemed ridiculous that they could actually make a get-away.</p>

</div>

<p>In the pass between two appalling peaks the two boys sighted the smoke of a
cook-fire, and without once reflecting that they were unarmed, pan-caked down
for a closer inspection. But there was no need to land. It was a band of
Indians. And though they searched till they were ready to drop with
fatigue,&mdash;and all but frozen stiff in those high altitudes,&mdash;not the sign of a
Mexican did they sight after that.</p>

<p>They returned utterly discouraged.</p>

<p>&#8220;What kind of Indians were they?&#8221; asked Long Lester.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, just Indians,&#8221; said the ranch boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is like saying, oh, just whites,&#8221; said Norris. &#8220;Indians differ
more than you would ever imagine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why is that, Mr. Norris?&#8221; Ted wanted to <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227'></a>227</span>know. &#8220;They&#8217;re
mostly mighty good for nothing specimens, to judge from our Diggers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you after supper,&#8221; Norris promised them.</p>

<p>Pedro had been out with his trout rod. Descending to the river, which here
circled around a huge bowlder from which he thought he could cast, he had a
string in no time.</p>

<p>Now Pedro was thoroughly well liked, with his Castilian courtesy and his ever
ready song. The lack of physical courage had been his greatest drawback. Always
had the fear been secret within him that at some crucial moment he might show
the white feather. His experience with the Mexicans had removed that, but he was
still mortally afraid of three things,&mdash;bears, rattlesnakes, and thunder
storms,&mdash;that is, real wild bears, not the half tame kind that haunt the
Parks.</p>

<p>Still, he had not noticed the furry form that stood neck-deep in the riffles,
fishing with his great, barbed paw,&mdash;so perfectly did he blend into the
background.</p>

<p>The shadow of the canyon wall had made twilight while yet the sun sent orange
shafts through the trees on the canyon rim. Suddenly <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228'></a>228</span>around the
turn of the trail rose a huge brown form that gave a startled grunt, rising
inquiringly on its shaggy hind legs and swinging its long head from side to
side. Pedro&#8217;s heart began beating like a trip-hammer. (He wondered if the bear
could hear it).</p>

<p>He wanted to run, to scream,&mdash;a course that would have been most ill-advised,
for the bear might then have given chase. As it was, the boy remembered that the
animal was probably more afraid than he,&mdash;or more likely merely curious at this
biped invasion of his wilderness,&mdash;and would not harm him if no hostile move
were made. The cinnamon bear of the Sierras, like his blood brother, the New
England black bear, is a good-natured fellow.</p>

<p>With an iron grip on his nerves, he forced himself to stand stock-still, then
back&mdash;ever so amenably&mdash;off the trail. The bear, finding no hostility intended,
turned and lumbered up the mountain-side.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Minds me of one time,&#8217; said Long Lester, when he heard the story,
&#8216;I was down to the crick once when I was a shaver, and along came a big brown
bear. The bear, he stood up on his haunches, surprised like, and just gave one
&#8217;woof.&#8217; About that time I decided to take to the tall timber.&#8221; (At this,
Pedro looked singularly gratified.) &#8220;Well, that bear, he took to the same tree
I did, and I kept right on a-climbin&#8217; so high that I get clear to the top,&mdash;it
were a slim kind of a tree,&mdash;and the top bends and draps me off in the water!&#8221;</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<a id='illus-229'></a>
<img src='images/illus-229.jpg' alt='' />
<p class='c'>Around the turn of the trail rose a huge brown form.</p>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229'></a>229</span>&#8220;What became of the bear?&#8221; Pedro demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;I dunno. I didn&#8217;t wait to see. But Mr. Norris here were a-sayin&#8217; there&#8217;s
nothin&#8217; in the back country a-goin&#8217; to hurt you unless&#8217;n it&#8217;s rattlesnakes. Now
when I was a-prospectin&#8217; I allus used to carry a hair rope along, and make a
good big circle around my bed with it. The rattler won&#8217;t crawl over the hair
rope.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boys thought he was joshing them, but Long Lester was telling the literal
truth. &#8220;Once I was just a-crawlin&#8217; into bed,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;when I heard a
rattle,&#8221; and with the aid of a dry leaf he gave a faint imitation of the
buzzing &#8220;chick-chick-chick-chick-chick&#8221; that sounds so ominous when you
know it and so harmless when you don&#8217;t. &#8220;I flung back the covers with one
jerk, and jumped back myself out of the way. There was a snake down at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230'></a>230</span>the foot of my blankets. They are always trying to crawl into a
warm place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then what?&#8221; breathed three round eyed boys.</p>

<p>&#8220;First I put on my shoes and made up a fire so&#8217;s I could see, &#8217;n&#8217; then I
take a forked stick and get him by the neck, and smash his head with a
stone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And yet I&#8217;ve heard of making pets of them,&#8221; said Norris.</p>

<p>&#8220;They do. Some do. But I wouldn&#8217;t,&#8221; stated Long Lester emphatically.
&#8220;Ner I wouldn&#8217;t advise any one to trust &#8217;em too fur, neither.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They say a rattler has one rattle on his tail for every year of his
age,&#8221; ventured Pedro.</p>

<p>&#8220;A young snake,&#8221; spoke up Ted, &#8220;has a soft button on its tail. And
then the rattle grows at the rate of three joints a year, and you can&#8217;t tell a
thing about its age, because by the time there are about ten of them, it snaps
off when it rattles.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Down in San Antonio,&#8221; said Ace, &#8220;we had an hour between trains once,
and we went into a billiard parlor where they had a collection of rattlesnakes,
stuffed. And they showed <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231'></a>231</span>some rattles with 30 or 40 joints to
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh!&#8221; laughed Ted. &#8220;That&#8217;s easy! You can snap the rattles of several
snakes together any time you want to give some tourist a thrill.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You seem to know all about it,&#8221; gibed Ace. &#8220;They had 13 species of
rattlesnakes down in this&mdash;it used to be a saloon. And ten of them Western. They
had a huge seven foot diamond back, and they had yellow ones and gray ones and
black ones and some that were almost pink. I mean, they had their skins. All
colors<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To match their habitat,&#8221; supplemented Norris. &#8220;Our California rattler
is a gray or pale brown where it&#8217;s dry summers, and in the Oregon woods where
it&#8217;s moist, and the foliage deeper colored, it&#8217;s green-black all but the spots.
<i>I&#8217;ve</i> seen them tamed. There was one guide up there who kept one in a
cage, and it would take a mouse from his fingers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t chance it,&#8221; shivered Ted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, this one would glide up flat on the floor of the cage. They can&#8217;t
strike unless they&#8217;re coiled.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose he caught it before it was old enough to be poison,&#8221; said
Pedro.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232'></a>232</span>&#8220;A rattlesnake can strike from the moment it&#8217;s born. It&#8217;s
perfectly independent a few hours after birth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ugh! Bet I dream of them now.&#8221; But such was their healthy out-of-door
fatigue that they all slept like logs.</p>

<p>It was only the next day, however, that the two boys, Ace and Ted, poking
exploratively into a deep cleft in a rock ledge, were startled by an abrupt,
ominous rattle, and beheld in their path the symmetrical coils of the sinister
one. The inflated neck was arched from the center of the coil and the
heart-shaped head, with red tongue out-thrust, waved slowly as the upthrust tail
vibrated angrily. A flash of that swift head would inject the deadly virus into
the leg of one of the intruders. Yet Ted knew the reptile would never advance to
the attack.</p>

<p>Dragging Ace back with him, he instantly placed at least six feet between
them, so that, should the snake charge, it could not reach them. But with the
enemy obviously on the retreat, the snake glided to cover in a tumbled mass of
rocks at one side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee! We nearly stepped on him!&#8221; the <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233'></a>233</span>ranch boy exclaimed,
with a voice that was not quite steady. &#8220;Next time we go poking into a place
like that, let&#8217;s poke in a stick first, or throw a stone, to make sure there&#8217;s
&#8216;nobody home.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wish I&#8217;d a brought a hair rope,&#8221; mused Ace. &#8220;We might have had one
that would go clear around all our sleeping bags. First chance we get, I&#8217;m going
to buy one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Naw! We won&#8217;t need one. Did you ever see a rattler catch a rabbit?&#8221;
asked his chum.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, d&#8217;you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Once I was going along when I noticed the trail of some sort of snake
going across the road. Next thing I heard a rabbit squeal, and by the time I
spotted the snake it had a hump half way down its throat, and it was swallowing
and swallowing trying to get that rabbit down whole.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I consider the possibility of rattlesnake bite the one biggest danger in
the whole Sierra,&#8221; declared Norris, one night, lighting each step carefully
over the rocks. &#8220;And he does his hunting by night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Considerate of him!&#8221; laughed Ace, &#8220;seeing <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234'></a>234</span>that campers
do most of theirs by day. But why is it such a danger? I&#8217;ve heard opinions pro
and con.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rattlesnake venom disintegrates the blood vessels, makes the blood thin
and unable to clot. I knew a man who was struck in the ankle, and they had to
amputate the leg, and the very bones of that leg were saturated with the blood
that had seeped through the weakened walls of the blood vessels.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How does it feel to be struck, I wonder?&#8221; the boy shuddered.</p>

<p>&#8220;This man&#8217;s ankle became discolored practically immediately and began to
swell. Of course the bite was through his sock, which must have kept a little of
the poison out of it, and it fortunately did not happen to penetrate an artery.
We could have cut and kneaded the wound instantly to clear out as much as
possible of the venom before it had time to enter the blood system, but the
fellow refused such heroic measures. We should have taken him by force; it would
have saved his leg, likely, for ordinarily this, and a ligature, will do the
work.</p>

<p>&#8220;Or we could have burned it clean, or injected the serum if we&#8217;d had
it. But as I was about <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235'></a>235</span>to explain, he soon became dull and
languid, breathing noisily, for the poison affected heart and lungs. It was
then that he let us get to work,&mdash;almost too late,&mdash;or rather, that he ceased
his protest. His whole leg swelled and turned black, clear up, he got feverish
and nauseated, and for hours he kept swooning off, while we worked over him,
almost giving up hope, and one of our men had gone post-haste for an old guide
who made the serum,&mdash;anti-venom serum.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did he finally pull through?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With the loss of a leg. If he hadn&#8217;t had that off pronto, gangrene would
likely have set in and he&#8217;d have gone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But this serum&mdash;where do you get it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. We got it of a man who made it. First he injected into a
mule a tiny drop of the venom.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How did he get the venom?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Killed a snake. You know the poison is in a tiny sac at the root of each
fang. Well, after he had given the mule the first dose and he had recovered, he
tried a larger one, then a still larger one, and so on, every few weeks for a
year or more, until the mule&#8217;s blood serum had <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236'></a>236</span>developed enough
anti-toxin to make him immune to rattlesnake bite.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But then what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He let some of the mule&#8217;s blood, separated the serum, sterilized it, and
put it up in sealed tubes, which he kept in the cellar. This serum is injected
into the victim&#8217;s blood with a hypodermic syringe, and if it is used before he
has collapsed, it will cure him every time. We really ought to have brought some
along, just in case of extreme emergency. I have, however, a bottle of
permanganate of potash crystals,&#8221; and he showed a little hard rubber tube two
and a half inches long, one end of which contained the crystals and the other a
well sharpened lancet, as the stuff has to be put right into the wound. This
outfit, he explained, had only cost a dollar, and was so tiny it could be
carried right on the person when in danger of being snake bitten. However, it
has to be used instantly, (within three or four minutes at the outside), &#8220;if
it is to neutralize the corroding acid of the poison and do any good.&#8221;</p>

<p>That night a bon-fire built up into a log cabin with a tepee of pine fringed
poles atop sent the <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237'></a>237</span>sparks flying, but was not uncomfortably hot
except on their faces. These they shaded with their hat brims.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder why there is so much difference in Indians,&#8221; mused Ace.
&#8220;When Dad and I visited the Hopis, there, on our way to the Grand Canyon, we
were impressed by their high degree of civilization. Like all the Pueblos, they
raised good crops, had a regular government, and even an art. And look at these
Digger Indians, filthy, thieving creatures, grubbing for roots like wild
animals, eating slugs and lizards, because they are too lazy to cultivate a
piece of ground!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I remember,&#8221; said Norris, &#8220;one of my favorite professors at Yale
always said that civilization was largely dependent upon civilization,&#8221; and
he pointed out the Indians as an illustration. Of course he gave due credit to
what he termed inherent mental capacity. But to climate he laid the energy with
which that capacity is developed,&mdash;always provided there were sufficient
material resources. That is to say, even white men with fine brains could not
evolve as high a degree of civilization in the <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238'></a>238</span>Arctic Circle as
they can where they have the material resources necessary to supply the physical
needs.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I should think the material resources of the Arctic Circle were a
result of the climate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In large part, they are. That just strengthens the point that climate has
had a lot to do with civilization, and incidentally with the differences between
different tribes of Indians. I wonder if I can give his theory straight! Well,
anyway, here&#8217;s the general idea. It applies quite as much to all nationalities
as it does to Indians in particular.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is our conception of The Noble Red Man? He is observant, he has
unlimited physical endurance, but he does not adapt himself to our civilization,
nor does he work out new methods for himself, as we have done since America was
settled. He is conservative, in other words,&mdash;lacking in originality and
inventiveness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course they came at some stage of their evolution from the primitive
home of man in Asia. So also did the Scandinavians,&mdash;so also did the Japanese.
But while both of these finally located in cold but not too cold climates,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239'></a>239</span>nor steadily cold, they were merely stimulated. The Indian,
though,&mdash;the American Indian,&mdash;likely migrated by way of Bering Strait, and
passing generations in the Esquimo lands, where it is about all they can manage
to keep alive at all during the long, dark winters. The result? Those who were
high strung nervously went insane,&mdash;just as many an Esquimo and many a white man
does to-day, under the necessity of idling in a stuffy hut in the cold and
darkness. It was only the mentally lazy who could survive that phase of their
evolution. That accounts for certain differences between all Indians and all
white men.</p>

<p>&#8220;Remember, it wasn&#8217;t the sheer cold so much as the monotony of the unbroken
cold and darkness. The negroes of Africa also failed to progress, but in their
case it was the energy-inhibiting equatorial climate, and especially the
monotony of unbroken equatorial conditions. The European Nordics,&mdash;remember, of
ancestral stock originating in that same Asiatic cradle,&mdash;had severe cold, and
in summer, often, extreme heat,&mdash;but there was no monotony.</p>

<p>&#8220;The too active Hottentot soon killed himself off, and only the indolent
survived. The races <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240'></a>240</span>that have had long sojourns, in the course of
their racial wanderings, under desert conditions, where patient endurance is an
asset, also suffered a decimation of their more alert members. The stolid were
the more fit to survive desert conditions. You will find races now dwelling in
favorable climates who may exhibit these unprogressive qualities, but back of
them is a history of some experience that has weeded out the more active
individuals.</p>

<p>&#8220;But am I getting too long-winded?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t told us yet why one tribe of Indians will be so different from
another, if they both came here via the Arctic Circle,&#8221; urged Ace.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, there is where another factor comes in,&mdash;that of material resources.
What could an Arab have accomplished with nothing but desert sands to work with?
What can the Esquimos accomplish with little but ice to grow crops? They must
secure their food by hunting, and hunters must be nomadic. Nomads cannot carry
many creature comforts with them, nor can scattered groups be much mental
stimulus to one another. Nor can the arts develop <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241'></a>241</span>when the mere
struggle for animal existence demands one&#8217;s whole energy.</p>

<p>&#8220;These Digger Indians came from the as yet unirrigated deserts around Los
Angeles, with its long dry season, whereas Hopis and other Pueblos around Santa
Fe, though up against as dry a climate, taking it in actual number of inches
rainfall per year, have enough of their rain during the summer months to enable
them to raise crops, and hence to establish permanent habitats, and hence to
work out a form of government, a social system, an art and an organized
religion.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But the Utes around Salt Lake City, who were living on grasshoppers when
the Pueblos were eating squash and beans,&mdash;utter savages,&mdash;didn&#8217;t they have much
the same climate as the Pueblos?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What I said of the Diggers of Los Angeles applies to them. Their rainfall
did not come at the right time of year to raise crops, and of course in such
desert conditions there were practically no wild fruits.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Indians of the more fertile parts of North America, like the early
people of Europe, <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242'></a>242</span>had wild vegetation to supply the means of
subsistence. And the wild vegetation also gave wild game a means of subsistence,
to say nothing of the means for clothing and shelter. Of course that is not the
whole of the story. There is, for instance, coal and iron, but iron has to be
smelted where there is forestation, and we come right back to climate, as one of
the principal factors in civilization.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is also energy,&mdash;zeal, determination. But what about the effect of
proper food and shelter on those qualities? And more important, what about the
effect of climate?</p>

<p>&#8220;Elaborate tests have been made. Without going into all that, perhaps you
will take my word for it. But the best climate for either physical or mental
efficiency is one that is variable,&mdash;for change is stimulating,&mdash;and that goes
to no unlivable extreme, but offers the cold, dry winter and the warm, slightly
rainy summer of, say, for instance, the Eastern United States, or Central
Europe, Italy, or Japan.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But why does a winter in Southern California do an invalid so much
good?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The change. The beneficial effects wear off with time. </p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243'></a>243</span>&#8220;And just one word more, while we are on the subject. I&#8217;d
hardly do my old professor justice unless I mentioned that he lays that third
factor in civilization, inherent mental capacity, to the climatic conditions,
not of the present, but of the ancestral history of the past. But remember, the
climate of, say, Greece, has not always been what it is to-day. Our Big Trees
show, by an examination of their annual rings, the same story that the rocks
tell,&mdash;and that history tells,&mdash;that there have been constant fluctuations of
climate, within certain limitations. The records of geology lead us to believe
that California and the Mediterranean countries have undergone the same climatic
variations.&#8221;</p>

<p>The next day the boys were so tired of sleuthing for the fire-bugs that they
decided to join the others in a holiday and explore one of the neighboring
peaks, leaving the burros and outfit at their camp of the night before. About
noon, the trail ended abruptly at a peak of granite blocks each no larger than a
foot-stool. Off to the left they could see a peak higher than the one
immediately before them. It seemed to be a ridge of three peaks, theirs the
middle one, <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244'></a>244</span>and once on the ridge, they could pick a course along
the crest.</p>

<p>A little further on, the trail narrowed till they could see a tiny lake on
either side, and a stone&#8217;s throw below, pools as clear as mirrors reflecting the
twisted growth about their brims. Then Ace gave a shout, for down a hollow
between two ridges to the north lay a patch of snow.</p>

<p>Sliding,&mdash;on their feet if they could manage it,&mdash;and snow-balling, the boys
were surprised to find how short of breath they were at this elevation, a trifle
over ten thousand feet, Norris estimated,&mdash;for on their steady upward plod they
had not particularly noticed it, or had not attributed their slightly unusual
heaviness to altitude.</p>

<p>They were therefore willing enough to rest on top, though even at noon the
wind blew cold upon them. Stretching almost north and south before them rose the
main crest of the Sierras,&mdash;peak after peak that they could name from the map.
They could see for at least a hundred miles. First the wild green gorges that
made the peaks seem higher, then snow-capped and glacier-streaked altitudes
rising one above another till they faded into purple nothingness.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245'></a>245</span>They did their climbing single file, with arms free, having
disposed of their lunch at timberline. But where Norris had led the way up,
Pedro was the first to start back. &#8220;Come on, why not take a short cut?&#8221; he
shouted in competition with the wind.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right.&#8221; Norris stepped on a rock at that moment that turned with
him, barely escaping a wrenched ankle. He kept his eyes on his footing for some
moments after that. It was therefore not surprising that he did not notice where
Pedro was leading, till the latter called:</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, there&#8217;s our lake, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>The way began to be all bowlders, larger and larger ones. &#8220;Here, that isn&#8217;t
the way we came,&#8221; cautioned Norris.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know it,&#8221; Pedro assured him, &#8220;but see, Mr. Norris, we&#8217;re just going
around this middle peak instead of over it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Better not try any stunts,&#8221; warned the Geological Survey man. Had he
been by himself, he would have gone straight back till he came to the way they
had gone up. But the boys were tired, and he hated to ask them to retrace their
steps. Besides, he did not want <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246'></a>246</span>to discourage initiative in the
Spanish boy.</p>

<p>But soon they found themselves scrambling over slabs so high that they had to
take them on all fours, clambering over one as high as their heads, then letting
themselves down into the cranny between that and the next.</p>

<p>&#8220;We sure never came over anything like this!&#8221; the rest of the party
began complaining. But on they scuttled, leapt and sprawled, no one finding any
better way.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurry, there&#8217;s our lake!&#8221; shouted Pedro finally. &#8220;I&#8217;ll bet if I could
throw a stone hard enough, it would scare the fish.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Norris spoke in alarm: &#8220;We couldn&#8217;t see any lake on the trail going up.
On the contrary, we saw the peak to our left. Don&#8217;t you remember? Now see! That
peak is on our <i>right</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fellows, we are on the wrong side of this ridge,&#8221; he decided. &#8220;And
what is more, instead of going back down the middle crest, we have gone clear on
to the third peak.&#8221; (For the ridge was a three peaked affair, the middle
being the lowest.) &#8220;The best thing now is to circle around as near the top as
we can go, till we strike the trail. If we keep circling, we are
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247'></a>247</span>bound to strike it sooner or later. But let&#8217;s not all go together,
or we might start a rock-slide. Let&#8217;s &#8216;watch our step!&#8217; What would we do if
one of you put his ankle out of commission?&#8221;</p>

<p>The boys had little breath to waste on comment. Probably none but Norris had
any vivid realization of the danger they were in, but each fellow had a keen eye
to keeping his footing. Rock-slides the three boys had never seen, but a
sprained knee or a crushed foot was something they could understand. Pedro also
had a weather eye out for rattlesnakes, to whom these rocks would have been
paradise if it had not been such a chill elevation.</p>

<p>As the sun sank lower and lower, they began secretly to wonder what it would
be to have to spend the night on this windy peak, without even an emergency
ration,&mdash;unpardonable over-thought! They circled steadily, Norris now in the
lead, the boys spreading out fan-wise as they followed, Pedro even getting clear
to the foot of the granite where he thought he would have easier going through
the woods, though he would also have a larger arc to traverse. He felt safer on
solid ground, though had he measured, he might have seen that he had climbed as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248'></a>248</span>far in going down as did the others in circling around.</p>

<p>Once a huge bowlder that overhung a precipice rocked under Ted, and it was
only by a swift spring that he saved himself. Many of the smaller rocks tipped
warningly, and he frequently stumbled. How slow their progress seemed! How fast
the sun was sinking in the west! And how astoundingly their shoes were wearing
through! It was three hours later that Pedro, down in the edge of the woods,
gave a shout and began waving his arms in the wildest manner. Then along the way
that he picked in coming to meet them, Norris with his glasses could just make
out the brown ribbon of the trail.</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes more and they were lined up ready for the homeward march,
cured once and for all of short-cuts, and divided only as to whether it would be
better to run, at the risk of a turned ankle, while there was light to see their
footing, or walk, and have to go the last half of the way in darkness.</p>

<p>They finally did some of both, running where the trail lay free from stones,
and eventually having to make their way by the feel of the <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249'></a>249</span>ground
under the feet, and the memory of the mountain meadows whose perfume they
passed, and the sound of the creek to their right. The stars were out, giving a
faint but welcome light that served as guide when finally they stumbled into
camp, bone-weary but safe, and nothing loth to set all hands for a square meal
before tumbling in.</p>

<p>Throwing some of their reserve supply of fuel on the fire-place, they soon
had the home fires burning cheerily, and Pedro was demonstrating his can-opener
cookery.</p>

<p>Next day a glitter from beneath the water of a rivulet high on the
mountain-side, caught Ted&#8217;s eye. Dipping with his tin cup, he brought up a
specimen of sand and water. Could it be only mica that glistened so? Saying
nothing to Ace, (for he remembered Long Lester&#8217;s tale of salting a mine once
when &#8220;the boys&#8221; wanted some one of their number to stand treat by way of
celebration of his new-found riches), he slyly slipped an aluminum plate from
out the pack and began that primitive operation that used to be known as pan and
knife working. Falling a little behind, he kept at it until he had separated out
some heavy yellow grains that proved malleable <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250'></a>250</span>when he set his
teeth on them. It was coarse gold!</p>

<p>It was now time to announce his find, which he did to the amazement of all
but the old prospector. A more careful inspection of the bend where he had found
it proved it to be only the tiniest of pockets, though under their combined
efforts that day it yielded what the old man pronounced to be about a hundred
and fifty dollars&#8217; worth of dust. Still, even that was not to be sneezed at, as
Long Lester put it, in terms of Ted&#8217;s college fund,&mdash;for they all insisted on
contributing their labor to his find. Ted, though, insisted equally that it be
their stake for another camping trip.</p>

<p>Later that same day they came to the remains of an old hut, now overgrown
inside and out with vines and underbrush. In one corner the old man unearthed
what he pronounced to be the rusted mining tools of the early days. A fallen
tree that lay across the doorway had to be chopped through and cleared away
before they could enter, and on stripping a bit of the dry bark away for
firewood, Pedro was puzzled to find what appeared like hieroglyphics on its
nether side. He showed Norris, but what it <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251'></a>251</span>could be he could not
imagine, till Norris happened to try his pocket shaving mirror on it. Then,
clear as carving, only inverted, they spelled out the legend:</p>

<p style='text-align:center'>&#8220;CLAME NOTISE &mdash; JUMPERS WILL BE SHOT.&#8221;</p>

<p>These were evidently the letters that had been carved on the tree trunk&mdash;as
they judged, about six feet above its base, and though the sap had long since
obliterated the original, the bark still told the story where it had grown over
the wound. By chopping through the log at that point and making a rough count of
the annual rings of growth, they estimated that all this had happened forty
years ago. What had become of the old miner? For such his tools acclaimed him.
Why had he never come back? Had he been overtaken by bandits, robbed of his
buckskin bag of dust, and murdered? Or had he struck a richer claim
elsewhere?</p>

<p>They dug beneath what once had been his crude stone hearth, in the hope of
buried treasure, but no such luck rewarded them, and finally they moved on up
the mountainside, past vistas of green-black firs and yellow-green alders. As
usual in these dry altitudes, the fiery sun of <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252'></a>252</span>noonday had grown
chill at sunset, the wind stopped singing through the pines, and the weird bark
of a coyote seemed to accentuate the loneliness that the wilderness knows most
of all when some abandoned human habitation brings it home to one.</p>

<p>But a heaped up bon-fire and a singing kettle soon drove the shadows from the
circling mountain meadow that was to be their home for the night.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thet there cabin,&#8221; drawled Lester, &#8220;sure made me feel as if I were
back on my old stamping grounds. &#8216;Minds me of the place where I once found a
chunk o&#8217; glassy white quartz half the size of my head with flakes of color in
it that netted me $200. I spent quite consid&#8217;able time hunting for the vein that
came from, but I never did, nohow.&#8221;</p>

<p>Norris explained to Ted and Pedro that a quartz bowlder will often be washed
along a river.</p>

<hr style='border:none; border-bottom:16px solid white;' />

<p>They were awakened by the usual concert of hee-haws, as the burros, who
followed at their heels all day like dogs, (except when they got contrary), woke
the echoes with their loneliness.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253'></a>253</span>That day led them over another of the parallel ridges that comb
the West flank of the Sierra, and into a precipitous canyon, over red sandstones
and green shales, and slates of Tertiary formation, till they came to another
hot spring and decided to pitch camp and all hands make use of the hot water. A
natural bath tub and a smaller wash tub were found hollowed out of the stony
banks, doubtless carved by whirling bowlders from the spring floods, and with
the joy known only to the weary camper they performed their ablutions, filling
the tubs, each in turn, by means of the nested pails. What grinding and whirling
it must have taken, they reflected, as they felt the smoothness of their
symmetrical bowls, to have hollowed these from the solid rock! With
accompaniment of drift logs tumbling end for end, as the river rose and foamed
beneath the thousand trickles of melting snow!</p>

<p>&#8220;Ever been up here in winter?&#8221; Ace asked the old prospector.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not exactly here, but I been places almighty like it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old prospector told them how, in the days of the 49ers, (vivid
recollections of which <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254'></a>254</span>his father had collated to his youthful
ears), the Mexicans had been treated in a way they had practically never
forgiven. The land was free. Discovery and appropriation of a mining claim gave
title, provided it was staked out and a notice scratched on a tin plate affixed
to the claim stake, and likewise provided that the size of the claim accorded
with the crude ruling for that region. Fifty feet was generally allowed along a
river, or even a hundred where the claim was uncommonly poor and inaccessible,
though where it was uncommonly rich, miners were sometimes restricted to ten
square feet apiece.</p>

<p>But Mexicans were generally refused the benefits of the gold claims, the
&#8220;greasers&#8221; often being ejected by force of arms from the more valuable
claims. Sometimes they were given three hours&#8217; grace for their getaway. More
within the letter of the law, a tax was imposed on alien claim holders, but at
first such a heavy one that it was practically prohibitive. This resulted in
border warfare, and to many of the Mexicans originally on the land, abject
poverty. At the Mexican dry diggings, which, with their bull rings and
fandangoes, had sprung up here and there in the foothills, there was bloody
defiance <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255'></a>255</span>of the tax collector. Other groups became highwaymen, who
robbed and murdered the blond race whom they felt had cheated and maltreated
them, stabbing from ambush, or organizing into bands of road agents, who
systematically robbed miners of their dust and stage drivers of their express
boxes, and as often murdering their victims.</p>

<p>There was Rattlesnake Dick, among other desperadoes, who with two gangsters,
Alverez and Garcia, had terrorized the gold diggings till, five years after the
gold rush, he had been killed by a rival bad man.</p>

<p>Ace was so tired, he rested again that day, merely bringing his bi-plane in
to the new camp site.</p>

<p>As Long Lester drawled over the camp fire, the drowsy boys lived again in the
days when a pinch of gold dust in a buckskin bag was currency, and red shirted
miners gambled away their gains or drank it up, in a land of hot sunshine and
hard toil, where a tin cup and a frying pan largely comprised their bachelor
housekeeping apparatus, their provender such as could be brought in on jingle
belled mule teams, their chief diversions the occasional open air
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256'></a>256</span>meeting or the lynchings of their necessarily rough and ready
justice.</p>

<p>The more adventurous always abandoned a moderate prospect for a gold rush.
Some of them made rich strikes; others ended their days in poverty, after
all.</p>

<p>The fire drowsed to a bed of red coals and the old man&#8217;s chin was sunk in his
whiskers, but still he talked on, almost as if in his sleep, and still the boys
propped their eyes open while they stowed away in their memories pictures of the
pony express riders, of the horse thieves branded&mdash;in this land of horseback
distances&mdash;by having their ears cut off, and of the unshaven miners, sashes
bound Mexican fashion around the tops of their pantaloons, the bottoms thrust
into their boots, slouch hats shading their unshaven faces, as they panned the
glittering sediments or built their sluices, with rocks for retaining the heavy
particles of gold washed over them.</p>

<p>Gold had been found in a belt 500 miles long by 50 wide,&mdash;and it was a
cherished myth that somewhere along the crest of the range lay a mother lode.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257'></a>257</span>But that, Norris told them, was not the way of the precious
metal. The &#8220;mother lode&#8221; was a myth.</p>

<p>The next day the two boys started once again to look for the incendiaries,
for when Ace set out to do a thing, it was do or die.</p>

<p>Pedro had now overcome his fear for bears, Mexicans, and getting lost, but
the too-gently reared youth had never conquered his nervousness at thunder
storms. He meant to, though, for he had come to consider useless fears as so
much surplus luggage. Just as when he was a small boy he had overcome his fear
of the dark by going right out into it and wandering around in it till he felt
at home in it, so now he meant to go right out into the next thunder storm that
came, becoming its familiar, till he knew the worst, and no longer felt this
unreasoning fear.</p>

<p>It was therefore with a certain satisfaction, (though coupled with an equally
certain inward shrinking), that as he scanned the skies for some sign of the
returning bi-plane, he noticed, rising above a green fringe of silver firs
across the canyon, the snowy cumulus of a cloud. This was about an hour before
meridian, the <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258'></a>258</span>time the usual five minute daily noon thunder storm
began to gather.</p>

<p>But to-day he noted with surprise, not unmixed with alarm, that beyond this
one small mountain of the upper air,&mdash;so like the glacier-polished granite
slopes beneath that it might have been a fairy mountain, swelling visibly as it
rose higher and higher above the canyon wall,&mdash;beyond this for as far as he
could see were other domes and up-boiling vapor mountains. What did it betoken?
A cloud-burst?&mdash;For Sierra weather is not like that in the Eastern mountain
ranges, and such an assemblage sweeping along the slopes and flying just above
the green firs of the lower forests must mean something beyond ordinary in the
line of weather.</p>

<p>Had he known more of Sierra weather, he would that instant have given up his
plan of being out in this specimen, but his new-born resolution was still strong
within him, and&mdash;he did not know. One above another for as far as he could see
the pearl-tinted billows rose from among the neighboring peaks, swelling visibly
as it rose higher and higher. Then they began floating together, the cloud
canyons taking on <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259'></a>259</span>grayer tints, then deep purplish shadows, and
their bases darkened with the weight of their vapory waters.</p>

<p>With the sudden reverberation of a cannon shot, the first thunderbolt crashed
just ahead of a blinding zigzag of lightning, and echoing and reëchoing from
peak to granite peak, with ear-splitting, metallic clearness, it rang its way
down the canyon walls, till the echoes died away. Soon the big drops began
spattering loudly on the granite slopes, till the drenched boy, bending his
hat-brim to the on-slaught, lost his footing in the new slipperiness of the
smooth, sloping rocks, down which a solid sheet of water now raced, dimpling
silver to the pelt of each additional drop.</p>

<p>Before he could collect his scattered wits, another thunder peal came
cannonading at the mountain mass, and almost behind him a solitary old fir tree
shook the ground with its fall. Another fir was slivered into huge splinters
that flew&mdash;fortunately for Pedro&mdash;just too far away to hit him. Then loosened
rocks and bowlders began bounding and re-bounding down the cliffs till their
thunder seemed as loud as that from the heavens.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260'></a>260</span>The lightning struck now here, now there, among the peaks,
attracted by veins of mineral.</p>

<p>Uneasy on account of the flying stones and falling tree trunks, Pedro was
about to take shelter by crawling under a shelving rock when the rock itself was
dislodged by a flash of lightning, and went pommeling to the slide-rock on the
slope below.</p>

<p>Seemingly all in the same breath, the rock-slide started, with a roar as of
fifty express trains, as it seemed to Pedro&#8217;s long-suffering ears. An electric
storm always does start snow and rock slides.</p>

<p>As if that had been the grand climax, the storm ceased almost as suddenly as
it had begun. By his watch it had not been an hour, but from the amount of
damage done to both the geography and Pedro&#8217;s feelings, it might have been a
year, or a century.</p>

<p>&#8220;But here we are, safe still,&#8221; he told himself in surprise. &#8220;After
this experience, I don&#8217;t believe there is anything worse anywhere to look
forward to. So what&#8217;s the use of worrying about anything any more?
Ever!&#8221;&mdash;The experience had been worth while. Just how he was to make his way
back to camp was another question.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<a id='illus-260'></a>
<img src='images/illus-260.jpg' alt='' />
<p class='c'>Loosened rocks and bowlders began bounding down the cliffs.</p>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261'></a>261</span>With the mountainside a choice between slippery, dripping rock
slopes and sliding mud, fallen tree trunks and soggy forest floor, it was no
mean test he had to meet. But as the irrepressible California sun once more
burst forth in golden glory, the clean-washed air was all balsamic fragrance,
every leaf and fir needle held at its tip a drop of opal, and the
birds,&mdash;emerging from the holes in which they had safely hidden, those who
survived,&mdash;burst into happy gratitude.</p>

<p>As luck would have it, an hour before the storm broke, the two boys had
sighted the smoke of a camp-fire hidden away down in the bottom of a gulch, with
slide rock to cut off any approach from the main ridge. Flying low, they could
actually identify fat Sanchez and his two companions, who had their pack burros
with them. It seemed too good to be true! But before they could decide whether
to sail down and try to capture them themselves, or to go for Long Lester, the
on-coming storm began to set them careening, and they had to fly out of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262'></a>262</span>elements at right angles to the storm&#8217;s approach.</p>

<p>Returning three hours later with the old ex-deputy sheriff,&mdash;it was a spot
not to be mistaken,&mdash;Ace gazed in complete stupefaction at the gulch where the
Mexicans had been encamped. For there was now nothing there but slide-rock!</p>

<p>The dust that still grayed the atmosphere spoke clearly of the
catastrophe. And there would not have been one chance in a million of their
escaping. That they had not done so, their non-appearance anywhere in the
neighborhood bore abundant testimony.</p>

<p>The Mexicans had been captured by those same natural forces they had tampered
with when they set the forest fires. The little camping party was free to
return as soon as their time was up.</p>
